The Curse of the Rumiirua : Being the Journal of Jebidiah Halfwitch
ルミールアの呪い
ジェビディア・ハーフウィッチ 著

lost my entire family to those damn things. Let's get that out of the way right now. My wife, my three children, even my hunting dog. Later, my brother as well. I know his wife will never forgive me, dragging her man into my madness and rage. I lost everything, including my soul, which wasn't doing me all that much good anyhow, truth to tell.

あれらの出来事で私は家族を全て失った。さあ、今からその悲劇を話そう。私の妻、私の3人の子供達、さらに私の猟犬。そして私の兄弟も。兄弟の妻は私を許しはしないだろう、私は彼を私の狂気と憎悪に巻き込んでしまった。私が全てを、私の魂まで含めて失ってしまったのは、私の自業自得なのだ、実のところは。


Rumiirua, they call them. And it's as good a name for those thrice damned sons of whores as any, I figure. But even so, these aren't like most Undead. If you've been around Tamriel at all, you've probably seen your fair share of critter and beast, or heard tell of them at least. Dark days, so they say. Animated skeletons aren't so troublesome a thing. Neither are normal Undead. They're mostly dumb; they don't travel in numbers too large, and are not so fearsome. There are a variety of ways to take one out. Typically, a Mage has set a few on a mission of a personal nature. Once that mission's complete, they usually just drop back to the dirt. If not, well like I said, if you know what you're up against and prepared, they're just not too formidable. 

ルミールア、やつらはそう呼ばれている。あのクソったれの亡者どもの名前としては悪くないだろう。しかしそれでも、やつらはたいていのアンデットとは違う。もしあなたがタムリエルで長く過ごしているなら、ほぼ確実に日常的にアンデッドの生き物と獣を見たことが、少なくとも聞いたことはあるだろう。嫌な時代だとそう言われている。動く骨どもはそう大した問題ではない。どちらも普通のアンデッドだ。やつらは大抵はのろまだし、大群で移動したりはしないから、恐れることはない。一体だけに対応するならさまざまな方法がある。典型的なのは、魔術師がいくつかの使命を与えている場合で、そいつらは使命を終えたら通常は土に返る。そうでなくても、私がよく言うような遭遇時の対策を知っていれば、それほど恐ろしくはない。


Rumiirua are nothing like that. First off, most of them are still full of meat. That's the thing, see? You smell them first. All that rancid, rotting meat. And you don't know where they are or how many. You just know they're close. And that puts the fear into you. That fear combined with the smell and all the other people in the vicinity panicking� it's easy to lose your self in the chaos. 

ルミールアはそうではない。第一に、やつらのほとんどには肉体がある。本当だぞ？まず最初にやつらの臭いがする。悪臭が、あらゆる肉が腐ったような匂いだ。そしてやつらがどこにいるか、どのくらいいるかわからない。やつらが近づいてくることだけがわかる。これには恐怖を感じるだろう。臭いと大混乱に陥った人々が結びついて呼び起こされる恐怖…その混乱の中で正気を失うのは簡単だ。


That's when the attack comes, coordinated and precise. These things have still got their wits about them. Well, mostly. Like I said, these are not normal Undead. These move with a purpose born of something personal. You can tell there is some coherent thought left. And you've never seen vicious until you've seen these things move as one.

そしてその襲撃は統制があり正確だ。その事実はやつら自身の知性が物語っている。まあ、ほとんどだが。私が言ったように、やつらは普通のアンデッドではない。やつらはある個人から与えられた目的で動く。あなたにもやつらに一貫した思考が残っていることが理解できるだろう。やつらが一体となって動くことほど、酷いものは見たことがないはずだ。


My name's Jebediah Halfwitch. There's a story behind the family name, but that's a tale for another day. And someone else will have to tell it. This story, assuming I get to finish it, is about what happened that night. And what I've done since. Some of it's true, those parts I witnessed myself. Some of it is speculation, parts that other more imaginative people have thought up, or heard from still others. But it may as well be true. You can believe or not. I don't care much one way or the other. By the time anyone finds this, I'll likely be worm food. But you would do well to listen, for I've found their weakness.

私の名はジェビディア・ハーフウィッチという。この性については背景があるが、それはまた別の物語だ。それはきっと別の誰かが語るだろう。この話は、やり終えるつもりだが、その夜に何が起こったかについてだ。そしてそれ以来どうしてきたか。いくつかは真実で、私自身が遭遇した部分だ。いくつかは推測で、想像力がある者達の考えや伝聞だ。それらも事実かもしれない。信じる信じないはあなた次第だ。それも私にはどうでもいいことだ。誰かがこれを見つけた時、私は虫の餌にでもなっているだろう。だがよく聞いてほしい、私が見つけたやつらの弱点を。


Magic folk; wizards, mages, necromancers and the like, they say there are other worlds. Worlds beyond counting. And they say there are doorways between worlds that can be traveled through, if you have the keys, that is. I've never witnessed such, but that doesn't mean it's not true. They tell of worlds what have strange square buildings climbing so high into the sky they get lost in the clouds. Worlds that have flying machines. Worlds with cities up in the clouds, where people travel between the stars faster than light in giant ships. I don't believe all that, but I guess you just never know, do you?

ウィザード、メイジ、死霊術士といった魔法使い達は、異世界が存在すると口々に言う。数え切れないほどの世界だ。そして彼らはこの世界のどこかに入り口があり、鍵を持っていれば行くことができると言う。私が直接見たわけではないが、どうやら嘘ではないらしい。彼らの伝承によればそれらの世界には奇妙な正方形の構造物が空高く雲に隠れるほどそびえ立っているという。空飛ぶ機械を持つ世界。雲の上に都市があり、人々が巨大な船で星間を光より早く移動する世界。私はこれら全てを信じてはいないが、私はそんなことは誰にもわからないと思う。あなたはどうだろうか？


Story I heard, there was a very powerful, very evil sorcerer from some other world. Eternia, he called it, a strange and wonderful place of both science and magic. A noble name, I reckon. But evil can come from good lands, and good can come from wicked places, so they say. Well if there's even a lick of truth to it, this sorcerer might just redefine evil. Not the kind of evil of gods and demons. No, I mean the darker evil of mortal ambition combined with a sociopathic lack of empathy or any consideration for one's fellow man. 

聞いた話では、非常に強力で、非常に邪悪な魔術が他の世界にいたらしい。エターニア、彼は科学と魔法にとって奇妙で素晴らしいその場所をそう呼んだ。高貴な名前だと、私は思う。しかし悪性は良い場所から来ることができ、良性は邪悪な場所から来ることができる、と彼らは言う。もしもそれが真実だとしても、この魔術師は悪を再定義するだろう。神や悪魔の悪性ではない。いいや、つまり反社会的人格障害として共感や仲間のための配慮が失われる死の野望のより暗い邪悪だと言うことだ。


This sorcerer was committed to total domination of his own world, but had emissaries and apprentices that would conquer other worlds in his name. That's where Mannimarco comes in. Maybe you've heard that name, if you've journeyed through much of Tamriel, that is. Mannimarco was one of his apprentices, and well on his way to conquering this world. I won't bore you with history you probably already know. He came very close to succeeding and was waging his endgame against to Mages Guild. Which at that time, would have been the last bastion of hope. His arrogance cost him his victory. He engaged in a direct confrontation with both the archmage Trabonius Artorius and his successor, the archmage Hannibal Traven. Together they brought him down and believed the realm to safe, with his passing. They even displayed his head on a spike outside their temple as both a warning and a trophy. 

この魔術師は自分の世界を征服しようとしていたが、彼の名で他の世界を征服する使者とその弟子たちもいた。それがマニマルコだ。おそらくその名を聞いたことがあるだろう。長くタムリエルを旅してきたのなら、その名を。マニマルコは彼の魔術師の見習いの一人で、この世界を征服しようとしていた。おそらくその歴史は知っているだろう。ここでは触れない。彼は野望の成就まであと一歩まで迫り、魔術師ギルドとの最終決戦を繰り広げた。そこ瞬間が、最後の希望の砦だった。彼はその傲慢さゆえに敗北した。彼とアークメイジ トレボニウス・アルトリウスとその後継者ハンニバル・トレイヴンとの直接対決。共に二人は彼を倒し国を救うと信じていた、彼の死によって。 They even displayed his head on a spike outside their temple as both a warning and a trophy. 


That was the end of the conflict, until the sorcerer learned of his apprentice's defeat. Upon hearing of the loss of Tamriel to his empire, he cursed to land to destroy not just those who stood against his plan, but all occupants of the realm. First he slaughtered an army, and then cast a spell reanimating the dead. He set his zombie army out across the land gathering numbers to their rank as they went on a journey of hundreds of miles to the Mage's Guild. You see, the zombie army was just the beginning. Any who were killed by the zombies, the Rumiirua to be precise, would be reanimated themselves and join the march to Mage's Guild.

それが決着となり、魔術師は見習いの敗北を知ることとなった。彼の帝国がタムリエルに敗北したと聞き、彼は国中を破壊するために計画の敵対者だけでなく全ての領主を呪った。最初に彼は軍を虐殺し、死者を蘇らせる魔法を唱えた。 He set his zombie army out across the land gathering numbers to their rank as they went on a journey of hundreds of miles to the Mage's Guild. 君が見たのは、ソンビ軍団の始まりに過ぎない。ゾンビによって殺された者達、ルミールアは正確には、蘇り魔術師ギルドへの進軍に加わるのだ。


That's the story. The Legend, if you will. And like all legends, just enough truth mixed in with the bullshit to keep everyone believing and repeating it. I suppose the origin of the monsters doesn't matter all that much. I'd heard the stories of a zombie army just outside Skyrim. Didn't pay it much heed. Till it came ripping through the walls of my home that is. 

それがこの顛末だ。ただの伝承だ、君がそう思うのなら。そして数ある伝承のように、虚実が混ざり伝えられてきた。私はこの化け物どもの起源はそれほど重要ではないと思っている。私はスカイリムの外でこのゾンビ軍団の話を聞いた。だがあまり気に留めていなかったのだ。やつらが私の家の壁を引き裂くまでは。


We were having supper when we first smelled the stench. Then we heard the noises; groans. Then we heard the screaming off in the distance. From the farmhouse adjacent to ours, the Jarobsons. I later learned that they all died. Well, maybe died isn't quite right. It was Makiia Jarobson himself who ate my wife's face. Damn all the gods to hell. I can still see the look in her eyes in her last minutes when she believed I would be able to save her. I need a minute.

私たちが夕食を取っているときにまず嫌な臭いがしてきた。それから騒音が聞こえたのだ。唸り声が。そして遠くから叫び声が聞こえた。隣の農家のジャロブソンから。後で彼らが全員死んだことを知った。いや、死んだは正しくはない。私の妻の顔を食べたのはマキーア・ジャロブソンだったのだから。クソッたれめ。今でも彼女の眼を思い出す、私の助けを信じていた彼女の最後の数分間を眼を。…少し時間がほしい。


Ok, like I said, we were having supper. I sat at the table with my two boys and my daughter. Thomas, 14. Gregory, 13. And Meagan at 11. Clover was under the table at my feet waiting for scraps. Amelia had just brought the food to the table. At first we joked about the smell being her supper. I hold onto that memory. The 5 of us laughing, sitting together. Happy. Enjoying each other's company. It was short lived, for I realized as the smell grew so much stronger so quickly that something was very wrong. I was just about to give voice to my concerns when we heard the first screams. 

…もう大丈夫だ、私が言ったように私たちは夕食を食べていた。私は2人の息子と娘と一緒にテーブルに座っていた。14歳のトーマス。13歳のグレゴリー。そして11歳のミーガンだ。クローバーはテーブルの下で私の足にじゃれついていた。アメリアは食事をテーブルに運んでいた。最初は夕食の匂いについて冗談を言ったんだった。思い出すよ。家族5人で笑いながら、みんなでテーブルについていたんだ。幸せだった。団欒を過ごしていたんだ。それも長くはなかった。匂いがどんどん強くなって、すぐに何かがおかしいと気づいたからだ。 I was just about to give voice to my concerns when we heard the first screams.


What happened then I cannot bear to relate in all of its detail. The pain is too near. But I will summarize. 

何が起こったか知るのにもう耐えられない。辛すぎるんだ。だが、まとめよう。


I took hold of my sword. As I only own the one, my boys grabbed garden tools to wield in defense. And out into the night we strode. Ready to seek out the danger and defend the homestead. In the dying evening light I could make out Constance, my neighbors wife, on the far end of my field, struggling with a group of attackers as she tried to make it to the safety of my home. I wondered why she left her home and where her husband Makiia was. 

私は剣を取った。剣は私の分しかなかったから、子供達は護身のために庭道具を掴んだ。そして私たちは夜に出た。危険を冒してでも家を守るために。 In the dying evening light I could make out Constance, my neighbors wife, on the far end of my field, struggling with a group of attackers as she tried to make it to the safety of my home. 私はなぜ彼女が家を去ったのか、夫のマキーアがどこにいたのか疑問に思った。


I told my boys wait there at the door and ran out into my field, Clover pacing me at my side. As her attackers surrounded her and threw her to the ground, I believed I knew the nature of the attack and thought to rush in beheading the closest one and thus discouraging the rest, and hold them at bay until Makiia joined me. It was then that I saw them tearing off not just her clothing but her flesh. I was half way to her rescue when they tore into her stomach and began pulling out her intestines. She was screaming like I've never heard anything scream before, but I've heard it many times since. I stopped and stood frozen in horror. Some of them began eating her guts, others seemed to just be watching and enjoying the show. I could not move. I began to truly see her attackers for the first time. Some seemed normal enough. Others were missing pieces. Others had their own guts hanging out. Others looked as if they had been exhumed from a grave and given new life, born again if you will. I could see rancid, mucid flesh hanging where limbs should be. I could see empty eye sockets. I began vomiting where I stood, much of it splattering my pants and boots. Constance kept screaming. There was no sanity in that scream. Only blind agony. 

私は息子たちに扉の前で待つように言いつけ庭へ出た。クローバーは横についてきていた。やつらは彼女を囲んで引き倒していたが、私はこういう時は一番近くの者の首を斬りおとせば連中の戦意を喪失させられると知っていて、そうするつもりで、マキーアと合流するまでやつらと膠着状態におこうとしていた。そこでやつらが彼女の服だけでなく肉を引き裂くのを見たのだ。私が彼女を助けようと近づく前にやつらは彼女の胃を引き裂き腸を引きずり出していた。彼女は今までに聞いたこともないような叫びをあげていた、だが私はこれ以来何度も聞くことになるのだ。私は恐怖で立ちすくみ動けなかった。やつらの一部は彼女の腸を食べ始めたが、他のやつらはまるでショーを楽しむように観ているかのようだった。私は動けなかった。そしてここにきて初めて彼女を殺したやつらを見たのだ。いくらかは普通の人間に見えていた。だが他のやつらの体は欠けていた。別のやつらは自分の腸をぶら下げていた。さらに別のやつらは墓から掘り返され新しい命を吹き込まれ、まるで生まれ変わっていたかのようだったよ。腐って悪臭を放ち、体のどこかの肉が腐敗してぶら下げていた。その眼孔は空だった。私は立ったまま嘔吐し、ズボンとブーツをびちゃびちゃにしてしまった。コンスタンスは叫んでいた。正気を失っているような叫びだった。眼が見えなくなった苦痛で。


Clover shot off into the fray, barking and growling as he ran. He launched himself at the closest one, the one I had planned on beheading, and knocked him to his side.  I couldn't see what happened to him but the yelps were telling enough. He was a good dog. You have to raise them from pups for them to be that loyal. It would take a good amount of time to replace him, train another. I actually remember thinking that.

クローバーは乱闘に向かって吠え、唸りながら走り始めた。彼は私が首を斬り落とそうとしていた一番近くのやつに飛び掛り、すぐ傍に突き飛ばした。私は彼に何が起こったか見ることが出来なかったが、その叫びで十分だった。いい犬だった。あれほど忠実にするには子犬の頃から育てなければならない。あれほどいい犬を育てるには、とても時間がかかるだろう。昨日のように思い出すよ。


I finally turned and began running back to my home where my boys stood with scythes and sickles just outside the door. I'd left Constance screaming, bleeding out into my wheat. Clover as well. I felt no guilt. My only thought was of my family. I ordered my boys in and told them to lock down everything. Doors were barred, shutters were locked. Barricades were set up. I tried to explain the situation to them but probably didn't make much sense. What about the situation did I really understand? I saw my Amelia eyeing the vomit on my boots, which were giving off an acidic smell. Saw the horror on her face as she realized the extent of the danger. I ordered her and Meagan upstairs to hide. My reasoning being that if the locks and barricades were unsuccessful, if my boys and I failed, we could still retreat upstairs. We could exit through a window and drop down the porch's overhang and flee into the night. My wife wanted for all of us to hide in the cellar. In my head, I was going to protect our home. I know now the home was irrelevant, and those in the home were everything. I'm sure I knew it then too, but pride was in the way of clear thinking. Fear also. Looking back, I wonder if they would still be alive if we had done what Amelia wanted. My dear sweet Amelia, missing half her face. 

At the time it must have felt like a heroic battle. My boys and I defending the home. My wife and daughter safe upstairs. I was an idiot. I don't know how long it took them to break in. Minutes probably. They surrounded the house and began pummeling doors and windows, breaking through sturdy wood and iron latches. Much of my rage and adrenaline dissipated when the first arm reached through the broken window shutters. I sliced it off cleanly at the elbow and did not faze the attacker in the least. My boys eyes grew wide in fear. Suddenly arms were everywhere. Reaching in, pulling boards out. Sword, sickle and scythe swinging with abandon. Limbs and blood and gore covering everything, soaking into the floorboards. And still they pressed on. Nothing would deter them. 

I realized it was a futile effort and was just about to enact our retreat and forfeit the house when one of them grabbed Gregory, my youngest. I heard him yell and turned to look just in time to see two of the attackers wrench his head from his shoulders. I went numb. I stood there, seeing but not understanding. It was Amelia who reacted. She saw from the top of the stairs. She ran down the narrow flight and shot across the room with unbelievable speed, stole Gregory's head away from the two undead leaning through our window, and began trying to re-attach it to his lifeless body. It may sound absurd, but it was more than I could do. I was still standing where I was, watching the horror unfold around me. I could hear weeping. I could hear her telling Gregory it would be ok. I saw the hands reaching for her from behind. Hands that belonged to Makii of all people. He was dead. One of his eyes was missing. There was a line of drool hanging from his mouth. One of his hands reached into her mouth, grabbed on for all it was worth and began pulling with inhuman strength. 

As half her face and scalp were pulled away, the paralysis finally broke. I ran to her and pulled her away from the rancid things invading our home, one of whom was my neighbor. I had helped him deliver a calf, for god's sake. And now as I looked back he slowly brought the scrap of Amelia's beautiful face and hair to his mouth and began chewing. I carried her upstairs yelling for Thomas to follow me. I remember him asking about Gregory but I don't remember answering him. I remember carrying Amelia down the hall and into our bedroom, Thomas and Meagan close behind. I remember locking and barricading our door while my two remaining children looked after their mother who was fading fast. 

�What do I do?�, Thomas yelled. I had no answer for him. I knelt down before her and held her hands. She looked at me and I have no idea if she really saw me, but there was an intensity in her eyes like she was trying to convey something. It could just be wishful thinking. Like I said, she was fading fast, bleeding out. There were no final words. No �I love you�. Just coughing and gurgling blood and sputtering. And that look in her eyes. Then she was gone. Just gone. An exhale and no inhale following it. Meagan began crying. Thomas looked to me to see what to do, but again I had no answer for him. My wife was dead on the floor in front of me. My youngest son dead downstairs. I had no answers. 

That was when the pounding on the door began. I knew we didn't have long. I began to prepare for our escape, quickly gathering a few items we would need on the road. They began to tear through the wood and I moved to push the dresser back in place reinforcing it, yelling for my children to grab the few items I'd gathered and climb out the window. That was when Amelia woke up. It was not Amelia anymore of course. But I didn't know that. For the briefest of moments I was so happy. I had been wrong. She wasn't dead after all. Then she grabbed Meagan and buried her ruined face into Meagan's neck and began chewing. With a large chunk of Meagan's flesh between her teeth, she jerked her head back violently, ripping tendon, tissue, and the carotid artery. Blood sprayed the room with an unbelievable pressure. Thomas was drenched in it. I began to scream �No�! It was all I seemed capable of. Repeating it over and over. 

I moved to pull Meagan away from Amelia and my wife began to growl at me. I threw Meagan in Thomas's arms telling him to back up, which of course was terrible advice. I turned to face my wife. I could see in her eyes it was no longer her. There was nothing but an evil hatred emanating from them. I understood what had to be done. Thomas did not. I took up my sword and brought it down through her skull, separating the half of her face with skin from the half without. Thomas began screaming. I stood there panting and turned to face Thomas just in time to see hands burst through the door he had backed up against and grab him. He dropped Meagan and screamed as he was pulled though the broken door. I rushed to look through the doorway but already the hall was too crowded with the undead to see him. But I could hear just fine as they were eating him alive. Screaming for me to help him for what seemed an eternity. That word will haunt me for as long as I go on. Dad. Screamed though the lips of a son I could not help. Over and over. I recall the first time he said dad when he was learning to talk. It was the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard. Now it was the sound of nightmares. 

I looked down at where Meagan lay on the floor. She had also passed. She took her last breath lying at my feet and I hadn't even noticed. I was too busy listening to Thomas scream �Dad�. 

I can't tell you how much I wish I had just sat down and held Meagan in my arms and waited for them to take me too. I have no idea why I didn't. No idea why I climbed out the window, dropped to the ground and ran away. But run away I did. It's all a blur. I really don't remember any other details until waking up in my brother Isaac's home just outside Whiterun two days later. It's a days journey to the small village where he lived and I must have run the entire way. He told me I was delirious, dehydrated and covered in blood when I arrived.

I told my story and passed back out. Apparently he rode to my farm saw for himself the devastation. Upon waking again, I asked questions he wouldn't answer. He simply said it was as I had described. He gathered all the men from his village and held a meeting at his home. Relaying all the details I'd given him to the others while I just sat and listened. Many of them had also seen firsthand the grisly remains. He wasn't the only one to investigate it seems.

A man named Johnson Russio filled in many details of what he called the Rumiirua. He said the story and warning had been given to him by a campfire one night by a strange traveler by the name of Keldor.  How Keldor came by this information or what he knew of their march to the Mages Guild, I have no idea. Neither did Russio for that matter. But all I know of the Rumiirua and their journey comes from Russio. So for what's wrong, blame him.

It was agreed that we would set out with many fighters and weapons and destroy them to protect the village. As I write this now I realize how stupid it sounds. But realize, it was a room full of bravado and men who would not show their fear. As well as more then a little alcohol. And I was too numb to care. 

Understand this. The Rumiirua had already passed the village. They were heading (North), presumably to the Mages Guild, and just happened to pass through my land. This village was a couple miles to the west. They were safe. For the moment anyhow. 

We picked up their back trail the next day and went after them. My brother's wife Sarah begged him not to go, but he told her the family must be avenged. The look she gave me spoke volumes.

After a long journey we found them in the next village to the north about 30 miles on. A great slaughter ensued, some of which I witnessed. Most of which I can only imagine, but in all fairness, having witnessed the things I have, I believe my imagination is sufficient. Yours will have to be as well. I had intended to write of the battle in as much detail as the attack on my home but realize now there would be no point. A great number of men died, most of which stood up and joined the ranks of the undead soon after. Much blood. Much viscera. Screaming and wailing. It seemed to go on forever. The men were not prepared to fight an enemy that couldn't be hurt. They would deliver killing blows and the Rumiirua would not even react to it. They never stop. They never tire. They march. They devour. And their numbers increase with every man that resists them.

I can tell you I saw my brother devoured. He died saving me. Our modest group of would-be soldiers had been overwhelmed. My brother and I were attempting to retreat. We rounded a corner and the Rumiirua were upon me. I had nothing left and was ready to let them take me. Isaac jumped between us and shoved me away. He looked into my eyes without fear and spoke his last words in this life. He said �Run, brother�, and then they tore him open. It saddens me all the more because he died for nothing. There's nothing here worth saving, wouldn't be even if I weren't dying. The only part of me worth anything died with my family back at the farmhouse. But the rest of me will catch up very soon. I was bitten. And now dark black lines of infection travel up my arm. I don't know if the bite itself is what turns people, or if all that die now join the Rumiirua. But I won't risk it either way. I won't join the march to the Mages Guild. Not if I can prevent it.

I should tell you I also saw Meagan and Thomas. This was before Isaac's death. There was nothing left of my children. They were devouring villagers dispassionately. I managed to cut them down, as Isaac looked on,. He knew it was something I had to do myself.. I took their heads off. That's the trick. Gutting them, taking limbs, it accomplishes nothing. You have to take the head. Which I discovered accidentally when cutting down my poor Amelia. And this is why Gregory didn't return of course. 

伝えておこう、私もミーガンとトーマスを見たと。それはアイザックが死ぬ前だ。あの子達にはもう何も残っていなかった。あの子達は無表情に村人たちを食い荒らしていたのだ。私はどうにかして彼らを斬りおとさなければならない、アイザックが見たように。彼はそれが何なのか知っていた、私自身が何をやらなければならないかを…私は彼らの進路を遮った。それが策だ。それらを切り、手足を奪う、だがこれで終わりではない。頭を奪わなければならない。私が可哀想なアメリアを斬り倒した時に不意に発見したものだ。これがグレゴリーが戻ってこなかった理由だ。

The battle is over now. All the villagers are dead. The Rumiirua ranks swelled to twice their previous number, and now they move on toward the Mages. I escaped the fate of the rest of them by pretending to be dead, lying underneath a few corpses. 

戦いは終わった。村人は全て死んだ。ルミールアの規模は二倍にまで膨れ上がり、今は魔術師達の方へ向かっている。私は死んだ振りをすることで他の村人のように死ぬ運命から逃れた、いくつかの死体の下に横たわるようにして。


I have to get home you see. That's what I'm doing now. I have the bodies of Meagan and Thomas in a cart, and I'm trying to get back home before the infection takes me. I'm still a couple miles away. I expect to find Amelia and Gregory still in the house. Once I'm home and we're all together again, I will pour oil all over the house, my family and myself. And I will light us on fire with a thankful heart. Our deaths will be of rest and peace. That is my only hope, that the fire will purify me and cleanse my sins. That it will consume me so completely, that there will be no body left to rise again once I am dead.

家に帰らなければならない。今、その帰路についている。私はカートにミーガンとトーマスの亡骸をつめ、私が感染してしまう前に家に帰ろうとしている。あと数マイル。家にはまだアメリアとグレゴリーがいるだろう。一度家に帰ったら、再び家族が揃ったら、家と、家族と、そして私自身に油を撒こう。そして感謝の気持ちを持って炎に照らされよう。私達の死が安らかで健やかであるように。それが唯一の望みだ、炎が私を浄化し、私の罪をも消し去ってくれるだろう。私は完全に焼き尽くされ、死んでも再び起き上がることはないはずだ。


It occurs to me now as I walk home pulling the bodies of my dead children, that Amelia was right. We should have hid in the cellar.
子供達の亡骸を家に引きずって帰りながら、アメリアが正しかったと、私の胸中に浮かんだ。私達は地下室に隠れているべきだったのだ。


This is my last rest before setting out on the last leg of my journey. I am in an old, abandoned temple in Whiterun. I have sat here for the last couple hours, gathering my strength and writing all this down. I have spoken my confession to the darkness and the dust, in the shadow of a broken cross. I seek no absolution. I will leave this journal here in front of the altar. I will leave it for my sister in law, in the hopes that someone finds it and delivers it to her. 

これは私の最後の旅支度の、最後の残りだ。私はホワイトランの古い放棄された聖堂の中にいる。私は最後の幾ばくかの時間をここに座り、力をふりしぼりこのことを全て書き留めた。私は崩れた十字架の影の中でこの暗闇と塵に懺悔した。許しを請うてはいない。この記録をここ祭壇の前に置いていく。義姉のために残したこれを、誰かが見つけて彼女に届けてくれることを期待する。


I'm sorry for your husband, Sarah. My brother. Isaac. He was truly noble and should not have died. Certainly not for me. I know I have failed all those that meant anything to me, and look forward to the release of Hell. If you should come across my family in the nekt life, tell them I'm sorry. Tell them that I love them so much and that I miss them. I hope they're in a much better place now. Better than where I'm going. 

貴女の夫にはとても申し訳無いことをした、サラ。私の兄弟。アイザック。彼は本当に誇り高く死ぬべきではなかった。本当に私のためなどに死ぬべきではなかったのだ。わかっている、私は全てに失敗したのだ、悪意がなかったといえ、地獄が私を待っているだろう。もし来世で私の家族に出会ったなら、私が謝っていたことを伝えてほしい。そして伝えてほしい、君たちをとても愛していると、失って悲しいと。彼らがもっと良いところにいると願っている。私がいくところよりもずっと良いところに。


I'm so sorry. 
本当にすまない。

I am so very sorry.
本当に、本当にすまない。
