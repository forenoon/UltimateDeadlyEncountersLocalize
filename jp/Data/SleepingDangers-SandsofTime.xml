The Curse of the Rumiirua : Being the Journal of Jebidiah Halfwitch


&lt;/p&gt;



[pagebreak]
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
&lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/I_letter.png'&gt; lost my entire family to those damn things. Let's get that out of the way right now. My wife, my three children, even my hunting dog. Later, my brother as well. I know his wife will never forgive me, dragging her man into my madness and rage. I lost everything, including my soul, which wasn't doing me all that much good anyhow, truth to tell.

Rumiirua, they call them. And it's as good a name for those thrice damned sons of whores as any, I figure. But even so, these aren't like most Undead. If you've been around Tamriel at all, you've probably seen your fair share of critter and beast, or heard tell of them at least. Dark days, so they say. Animated skeletons aren't so troublesome a thing. Neither are normal Undead. They're mostly dumb; they don't travel in numbers too large, and are not so fearsome. There are a variety of ways to take one out. Typically, a Mage has set a few on a mission of a personal nature. Once that mission's complete, they usually just drop back to the dirt. If not, well like I said, if you know what you're up against and prepared, they're just not too formidable. 

Rumiirua are nothing like that. First off, most of them are still full of meat. That's the thing, see? You smell them first. All that rancid, rotting meat. And you don't know where they are or how many. You just know they're close. And that puts the fear into you. That fear combined with the smell and all the other people in the vicinity panicking… it's easy to lose your self in the chaos. 

That's when the attack comes, coordinated and precise. These things have still got their wits about them. Well, mostly. Like I said, these are not normal Undead. These move with a purpose born of something personal. You can tell there is some coherent thought left. And you've never seen vicious until you've seen these things move as one.

My name's Jebediah Halfwitch. There's a story behind the family name, but that's a tale for another day. And someone else will have to tell it. This story, assuming I get to finish it, is about what happened that night. And what I've done since. Some of it's true, those parts I witnessed myself. Some of it is speculation, parts that other more imaginative people have thought up, or heard from still others. But it may as well be true. You can believe or not. I don't care much one way or the other. By the time anyone finds this, I'll likely be worm food. But you would do well to listen, for I've found their weakness.

Magic folk; wizards, mages, necromancers and the like, they say there are other worlds. Worlds beyond counting. And they say there are doorways between worlds that can be traveled through, if you have the keys, that is. I've never witnessed such, but that doesn't mean it's not true. They tell of worlds what have strange square buildings climbing so high into the sky they get lost in the clouds. Worlds that have flying machines. Worlds with cities up in the clouds, where people travel between the stars faster than light in giant ships. I don't believe all that, but I guess you just never know, do you?

Story I heard, there was a very powerful, very evil sorcerer from some other world. Eternia, he called it, a strange and wonderful place of both science and magic. A noble name, I reckon. But evil can come from good lands, and good can come from wicked places, so they say. Well if there's even a lick of truth to it, this sorcerer might just redefine evil. Not the kind of evil of gods and demons. No, I mean the darker evil of mortal ambition combined with a sociopathic lack of empathy or any consideration for one's fellow man. 

This sorcerer was committed to total domination of his own world, but had emissaries and apprentices that would conquer other worlds in his name. That's where Mannimarco comes in. Maybe you've heard that name, if you've journeyed through much of Tamriel, that is. Mannimarco was one of his apprentices, and well on his way to conquering this world. I won't bore you with history you probably already know. He came very close to succeeding and was waging his endgame against to Mages Guild. Which at that time, would have been the last bastion of hope. His arrogance cost him his victory. He engaged in a direct confrontation with both the archmage Trabonius Artorius and his successor, the archmage Hannibal Traven. Together they brought him down and believed the realm to safe, with his passing. They even displayed his head on a spike outside their temple as both a warning and a trophy. 

That was the end of the conflict, until the sorcerer learned of his apprentice's defeat. Upon hearing of the loss of Tamriel to his empire, he cursed to land to destroy not just those who stood against his plan, but all occupants of the realm. First he slaughtered an army, and then cast a spell reanimating the dead. He set his zombie army out across the land gathering numbers to their rank as they went on a journey of hundreds of miles to the Mage's Guild. You see, the zombie army was just the beginning. Any who were killed by the zombies, the Rumiirua to be precise, would be reanimated themselves and join the march to Mage's Guild.

That's the story. The Legend, if you will. And like all legends, just enough truth mixed in with the bullshit to keep everyone believing and repeating it. I suppose the origin of the monsters doesn't matter all that much. I'd heard the stories of a zombie army just outside Skyrim. Didn't pay it much heed. Till it came ripping through the walls of my home that is. 

We were having supper when we first smelled the stench. Then we heard the noises; groans. Then we heard the screaming off in the distance. From the farmhouse adjacent to ours, the Jarobsons. I later learned that they all died. Well, maybe died isn't quite right. It was Makiia Jarobson himself who ate my wife's face. Damn all the gods to hell. I can still see the look in her eyes in her last minutes when she believed I would be able to save her. I need a minute.

Ok, like I said, we were having supper. I sat at the table with my two boys and my daughter. Thomas, 14. Gregory, 13. And Meagan at 11. Clover was under the table at my feet waiting for scraps. Amelia had just brought the food to the table. At first we joked about the smell being her supper. I hold onto that memory. The 5 of us laughing, sitting together. Happy. Enjoying each other's company. It was short lived, for I realized as the smell grew so much stronger so quickly that something was very wrong. I was just about to give voice to my concerns when we heard the first screams. 

What happened then I cannot bear to relate in all of its detail. The pain is too near. But I will summarize. 

I took hold of my sword. As I only own the one, my boys grabbed garden tools to wield in defense. And out into the night we strode. Ready to seek out the danger and defend the homestead. In the dying evening light I could make out Constance, my neighbors wife, on the far end of my field, struggling with a group of attackers as she tried to make it to the safety of my home. I wondered why she left her home and where her husband Makiia was. 

I told my boys wait there at the door and ran out into my field, Clover pacing me at my side. As her attackers surrounded her and threw her to the ground, I believed I knew the nature of the attack and thought to rush in beheading the closest one and thus discouraging the rest, and hold them at bay until Makiia joined me. It was then that I saw them tearing off not just her clothing but her flesh. I was half way to her rescue when they tore into her stomach and began pulling out her intestines. She was screaming like I've never heard anything scream before, but I've heard it many times since. I stopped and stood frozen in horror. Some of them began eating her guts, others seemed to just be watching and enjoying the show. I could not move. I began to truly see her attackers for the first time. Some seemed normal enough. Others were missing pieces. Others had their own guts hanging out. Others looked as if they had been exhumed from a grave and given new life, born again if you will. I could see rancid, mucid flesh hanging where limbs should be. I could see empty eye sockets. I began vomiting where I stood, much of it splattering my pants and boots. Constance kept screaming. There was no sanity in that scream. Only blind agony. 

Clover shot off into the fray, barking and growling as he ran. He launched himself at the closest one, the one I had planned on beheading, and knocked him to his side.  I couldn't see what happened to him but the yelps were telling enough. He was a good dog. You have to raise them from pups for them to be that loyal. It would take a good amount of time to replace him, train another. I actually remember thinking that.

I finally turned and began running back to my home where my boys stood with scythes and sickles just outside the door. I'd left Constance screaming, bleeding out into my wheat. Clover as well. I felt no guilt. My only thought was of my family. I ordered my boys in and told them to lock down everything. Doors were barred, shutters were locked. Barricades were set up. I tried to explain the situation to them but probably didn't make much sense. What about the situation did I really understand? I saw my Amelia eyeing the vomit on my boots, which were giving off an acidic smell. Saw the horror on her face as she realized the extent of the danger. I ordered her and Meagan upstairs to hide. My reasoning being that if the locks and barricades were unsuccessful, if my boys and I failed, we could still retreat upstairs. We could exit through a window and drop down the porch's overhang and flee into the night. My wife wanted for all of us to hide in the cellar. In my head, I was going to protect our home. I know now the home was irrelevant, and those in the home were everything. I'm sure I knew it then too, but pride was in the way of clear thinking. Fear also. Looking back, I wonder if they would still be alive if we had done what Amelia wanted. My dear sweet Amelia, missing half her face. 

At the time it must have felt like a heroic battle. My boys and I defending the home. My wife and daughter safe upstairs. I was an idiot. I don't know how long it took them to break in. Minutes probably. They surrounded the house and began pummeling doors and windows, breaking through sturdy wood and iron latches. Much of my rage and adrenaline dissipated when the first arm reached through the broken window shutters. I sliced it off cleanly at the elbow and did not faze the attacker in the least. My boys eyes grew wide in fear. Suddenly arms were everywhere. Reaching in, pulling boards out. Sword, sickle and scythe swinging with abandon. Limbs and blood and gore covering everything, soaking into the floorboards. And still they pressed on. Nothing would deter them. 

I realized it was a futile effort and was just about to enact our retreat and forfeit the house when one of them grabbed Gregory, my youngest. I heard him yell and turned to look just in time to see two of the attackers wrench his head from his shoulders. I went numb. I stood there, seeing but not understanding. It was Amelia who reacted. She saw from the top of the stairs. She ran down the narrow flight and shot across the room with unbelievable speed, stole Gregory's head away from the two undead leaning through our window, and began trying to re-attach it to his lifeless body. It may sound absurd, but it was more than I could do. I was still standing where I was, watching the horror unfold around me. I could hear weeping. I could hear her telling Gregory it would be ok. I saw the hands reaching for her from behind. Hands that belonged to Makii of all people. He was dead. One of his eyes was missing. There was a line of drool hanging from his mouth. One of his hands reached into her mouth, grabbed on for all it was worth and began pulling with inhuman strength. 

As half her face and scalp were pulled away, the paralysis finally broke. I ran to her and pulled her away from the rancid things invading our home, one of whom was my neighbor. I had helped him deliver a calf, for god's sake. And now as I looked back he slowly brought the scrap of Amelia's beautiful face and hair to his mouth and began chewing. I carried her upstairs yelling for Thomas to follow me. I remember him asking about Gregory but I don't remember answering him. I remember carrying Amelia down the hall and into our bedroom, Thomas and Meagan close behind. I remember locking and barricading our door while my two remaining children looked after their mother who was fading fast. 

“What do I do?”, Thomas yelled. I had no answer for him. I knelt down before her and held her hands. She looked at me and I have no idea if she really saw me, but there was an intensity in her eyes like she was trying to convey something. It could just be wishful thinking. Like I said, she was fading fast, bleeding out. There were no final words. No “I love you”. Just coughing and gurgling blood and sputtering. And that look in her eyes. Then she was gone. Just gone. An exhale and no inhale following it. Meagan began crying. Thomas looked to me to see what to do, but again I had no answer for him. My wife was dead on the floor in front of me. My youngest son dead downstairs. I had no answers. 

That was when the pounding on the door began. I knew we didn't have long. I began to prepare for our escape, quickly gathering a few items we would need on the road. They began to tear through the wood and I moved to push the dresser back in place reinforcing it, yelling for my children to grab the few items I'd gathered and climb out the window. That was when Amelia woke up. It was not Amelia anymore of course. But I didn't know that. For the briefest of moments I was so happy. I had been wrong. She wasn't dead after all. Then she grabbed Meagan and buried her ruined face into Meagan's neck and began chewing. With a large chunk of Meagan's flesh between her teeth, she jerked her head back violently, ripping tendon, tissue, and the carotid artery. Blood sprayed the room with an unbelievable pressure. Thomas was drenched in it. I began to scream “No”! It was all I seemed capable of. Repeating it over and over. 

I moved to pull Meagan away from Amelia and my wife began to growl at me. I threw Meagan in Thomas's arms telling him to back up, which of course was terrible advice. I turned to face my wife. I could see in her eyes it was no longer her. There was nothing but an evil hatred emanating from them. I understood what had to be done. Thomas did not. I took up my sword and brought it down through her skull, separating the half of her face with skin from the half without. Thomas began screaming. I stood there panting and turned to face Thomas just in time to see hands burst through the door he had backed up against and grab him. He dropped Meagan and screamed as he was pulled though the broken door. I rushed to look through the doorway but already the hall was too crowded with the undead to see him. But I could hear just fine as they were eating him alive. Screaming for me to help him for what seemed an eternity. That word will haunt me for as long as I go on. Dad. Screamed though the lips of a son I could not help. Over and over. I recall the first time he said dad when he was learning to talk. It was the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard. Now it was the sound of nightmares. 

I looked down at where Meagan lay on the floor. She had also passed. She took her last breath lying at my feet and I hadn't even noticed. I was too busy listening to Thomas scream “Dad”. 

I can't tell you how much I wish I had just sat down and held Meagan in my arms and waited for them to take me too. I have no idea why I didn't. No idea why I climbed out the window, dropped to the ground and ran away. But run away I did. It's all a blur. I really don't remember any other details until waking up in my brother Isaac's home just outside Whiterun two days later. It's a days journey to the small village where he lived and I must have run the entire way. He told me I was delirious, dehydrated and covered in blood when I arrived.

I told my story and passed back out. Apparently he rode to my farm saw for himself the devastation. Upon waking again, I asked questions he wouldn't answer. He simply said it was as I had described. He gathered all the men from his village and held a meeting at his home. Relaying all the details I'd given him to the others while I just sat and listened. Many of them had also seen firsthand the grisly remains. He wasn't the only one to investigate it seems.

A man named Johnson Russio filled in many details of what he called the Rumiirua. He said the story and warning had been given to him by a campfire one night by a strange traveler by the name of Keldor.  How Keldor came by this information or what he knew of their march to the Mages Guild, I have no idea. Neither did Russio for that matter. But all I know of the Rumiirua and their journey comes from Russio. So for what's wrong, blame him.

It was agreed that we would set out with many fighters and weapons and destroy them to protect the village. As I write this now I realize how stupid it sounds. But realize, it was a room full of bravado and men who would not show their fear. As well as more then a little alcohol. And I was too numb to care. 

Understand this. The Rumiirua had already passed the village. They were heading (North), presumably to the Mages Guild, and just happened to pass through my land. This village was a couple miles to the west. They were safe. For the moment anyhow. 

We picked up their back trail the next day and went after them. My brother's wife Sarah begged him not to go, but he told her the family must be avenged. The look she gave me spoke volumes.

After a long journey we found them in the next village to the north about 30 miles on. A great slaughter ensued, some of which I witnessed. Most of which I can only imagine, but in all fairness, having witnessed the things I have, I believe my imagination is sufficient. Yours will have to be as well. I had intended to write of the battle in as much detail as the attack on my home but realize now there would be no point. A great number of men died, most of which stood up and joined the ranks of the undead soon after. Much blood. Much viscera. Screaming and wailing. It seemed to go on forever. The men were not prepared to fight an enemy that couldn't be hurt. They would deliver killing blows and the Rumiirua would not even react to it. They never stop. They never tire. They march. They devour. And their numbers increase with every man that resists them.

I can tell you I saw my brother devoured. He died saving me. Our modest group of would-be soldiers had been overwhelmed. My brother and I were attempting to retreat. We rounded a corner and the Rumiirua were upon me. I had nothing left and was ready to let them take me. Isaac jumped between us and shoved me away. He looked into my eyes without fear and spoke his last words in this life. He said “Run, brother”, and then they tore him open. It saddens me all the more because he died for nothing. There's nothing here worth saving, wouldn't be even if I weren't dying. The only part of me worth anything died with my family back at the farmhouse. But the rest of me will catch up very soon. I was bitten. And now dark black lines of infection travel up my arm. I don't know if the bite itself is what turns people, or if all that die now join the Rumiirua. But I won't risk it either way. I won't join the march to the Mages Guild. Not if I can prevent it.

I should tell you I also saw Meagan and Thomas. This was before Isaac's death. There was nothing left of my children. They were devouring villagers dispassionately. I managed to cut them down, as Isaac looked on,. He knew it was something I had to do myself.. I took their heads off. That's the trick. Gutting them, taking limbs, it accomplishes nothing. You have to take the head. Which I discovered accidentally when cutting down my poor Amelia. And this is why Gregory didn't return of course. 

The battle is over now. All the villagers are dead. The Rumiirua ranks swelled to twice their previous number, and now they move on toward the Mages. I escaped the fate of the rest of them by pretending to be dead, lying underneath a few corpses. 

I have to get home you see. That's what I'm doing now. I have the bodies of Meagan and Thomas in a cart, and I'm trying to get back home before the infection takes me. I'm still a couple miles away. I expect to find Amelia and Gregory still in the house. Once I'm home and we're all together again, I will pour oil all over the house, my family and myself. And I will light us on fire with a thankful heart. Our deaths will be of rest and peace. That is my only hope, that the fire will purify me and cleanse my sins. That it will consume me so completely, that there will be no body left to rise again once I am dead.

It occurs to me now as I walk home pulling the bodies of my dead children, that Amelia was right. We should have hid in the cellar.

This is my last rest before setting out on the last leg of my journey. I am in an old, abandoned temple in Whiterun. I have sat here for the last couple hours, gathering my strength and writing all this down. I have spoken my confession to the darkness and the dust, in the shadow of a broken cross. I seek no absolution. I will leave this journal here in front of the altar. I will leave it for my sister in law, in the hopes that someone finds it and delivers it to her. 

I'm sorry for your husband, Sarah. My brother. Isaac. He was truly noble and should not have died. Certainly not for me. I know I have failed all those that meant anything to me, and look forward to the release of Hell. If you should come across my family in the nekt life, tell them I'm sorry. Tell them that I love them so much and that I miss them. I hope they're in a much better place now. Better than where I'm going. 

I'm so sorry. 

I am so very sorry.

ルミールアの呪い
ジェビディア・ハーフウィッチ 著


&lt;/p&gt;



[pagebreak]
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
&lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/I_letter.png'&gt; あれらの出来事で私は家族を全て失った。さあ、今からその悲劇を話そう。私の妻、私の3人の子供達、さらに私の猟犬。そして私の兄弟も。兄弟の妻は私を許しはしないだろう、私は彼を私の狂気と憎悪に巻き込んでしまった。私が全てを、私の魂まで含めて失ってしまったのは、私の自業自得なのだ、実のところは。

ルミールア、やつらはそう呼ばれている。あのクソったれの亡者どもの名前としては悪くないだろう。しかしそれでも、やつらはたいていのアンデットとは違う。もしあなたがタムリエルで長く過ごしているなら、ほぼ確実に日常的にアンデッドの生き物と獣を見たことが、少なくとも聞いたことはあるだろう。嫌な時代だとそう言われている。動く骨どもはそう大した問題ではない。どちらも普通のアンデッドだ。やつらは大抵はのろまだし、大群で移動したりはしないから、恐れることはない。一体だけに対応するならさまざまな方法がある。典型的なのは、魔術師がいくつかの使命を与えている場合で、そいつらは使命を終えたら通常は土に返る。そうでなくても、私がよく言うような遭遇時の対策を知っていれば、それほど恐ろしくはない。

ルミールアはそうではない。第一に、やつらのほとんどには肉体がある。本当だぞ？まず最初にやつらの臭いがする。悪臭が、あらゆる肉が腐ったような匂いだ。そしてやつらがどこにいるか、どのくらいいるかわからない。やつらが近づいてくることだけがわかる。これには恐怖を感じるだろう。臭いと大混乱に陥った人々が結びついて呼び起こされる恐怖…その混乱の中で正気を失うのは簡単だ。

そしてその襲撃は統制があり正確だ。その事実はやつら自身の知性が物語っている。まあ、ほとんどだが。私が言ったように、やつらは普通のアンデッドではない。やつらはある個人から与えられた目的で動く。あなたにもやつらに一貫した思考が残っていることが理解できるだろう。やつらが一体となって動くことほど、酷いものは見たことがないはずだ。

私の名はジェビディア・ハーフウィッチという。この性については背景があるが、それはまた別の物語だ。それはきっと別の誰かが語るだろう。この話は、やり終えるつもりだが、その夜に何が起こったかについてだ。そしてそれ以来どうしてきたか。いくつかは真実で、私自身が遭遇した部分だ。いくつかは推測で、想像力がある者達の考えや伝聞だ。それらも事実かもしれない。信じる信じないはあなた次第だ。それも私にはどうでもいいことだ。誰かがこれを見つけた時、私はワームの餌にでもなっているだろう。だがよく聞いてほしい、私が見つけたやつらの弱点を。

ウィザード、メイジ、死霊術士といった魔法使い達は、異世界が存在すると口々に言う。数え切れないほどの世界だ。そして彼らはこの世界のどこかに入り口があり、鍵を持っていれば行くことができると言う。私が直接見たわけではないが、どうやら嘘ではないらしい。彼らの伝承によればそれらの世界には奇妙な正方形の構造物が空高く雲に隠れるほどそびえ立っているという。空飛ぶ機械を持つ世界。雲の上に都市があり、人々が巨大な船で星間を光より早く移動する世界。私はこれら全てを信じてはいないが、私はそんなことは誰にもわからないと思う。あなたはどうだろうか？

聞いた話では、非常に強力で、非常に邪悪な魔術が他の世界にいたらしい。エターニア、彼は科学と魔法にとって奇妙で素晴らしいその場所をそう呼んだ。高貴な名前だと、私は思う。しかし悪性は良い場所から来ることができ、良性は邪悪な場所から来ることができる、と彼らは言う。もしもそれが真実だとしても、この魔術師は悪を再定義するだろう。神や悪魔の悪性ではない。いいや、つまり反社会的人格障害として共感や仲間のための配慮が失われる死の野望のより暗い邪悪だと言うことだ。

この魔術師は自分の世界を征服しようとしていたが、彼の名で他の世界を征服する使者とその弟子たちもいた。それがマニマルコだ。おそらくその名を聞いたことがあるだろう。長くタムリエルを旅してきたのなら、その名を。マニマルコは彼の魔術師の見習いの一人で、この世界を征服しようとしていた。おそらくその歴史は知っているだろう。ここでは触れない。彼は野望の成就まであと一歩まで迫り、魔術師ギルドとの最終決戦を繰り広げた。そこ瞬間が、最後の希望の砦だった。彼はその傲慢さゆえに敗北した。彼とアークメイジ トレボニウス・アルトリウスとその後継者ハンニバル・トレイヴンとの直接対決。共に二人は彼を倒し国を救うと信じていた、彼の死によって。 They even displayed his head on a spike outside their temple as both a warning and a trophy. 

それが決着となり、魔術師は見習いの敗北を知ることとなった。彼の帝国がタムリエルに敗北したと聞き、彼は国中を破壊するために計画の敵対者だけでなく全ての領主を呪った。最初に彼は軍を虐殺し、死者を蘇らせる魔法を唱えた。 He set his zombie army out across the land gathering numbers to their rank as they went on a journey of hundreds of miles to the Mage's Guild. 君が見たのは、ソンビ軍団の始まりに過ぎない。ゾンビによって殺された者達、ルミールアは正確には、蘇り魔術師ギルドへの進軍に加わるのだ。

それがこの顛末だ。ただの伝承だ、君がそう思うのなら。そして数ある伝承のように、虚実が混ざり伝えられてきた。私はこの化け物どもの起源はそれほど重要ではないと思っている。私はスカイリムの外でこのゾンビ軍団の話を聞いた。だがあまり気に留めていなかったのだ。やつらが私の家の壁を引き裂くまでは。

私たちが夕食を取っているときにまず嫌な臭いがしてきた。それから騒音が聞こえたのだ。唸り声が。そして遠くから叫び声が聞こえた。隣の農家のジャロブソンから。後で彼らが全員死んだことを知った。いや、死んだは正しくはない。私の妻の顔を食べたのはマキーア・ジャロブソンだったのだから。クソッたれめ。今でも彼女の眼を思い出す、私の助けを信じていた彼女の最後の数分間を眼を。…少し時間がほしい。

…もう大丈夫だ、私が言ったように私たちは夕食を食べていた。私は2人の息子と娘と一緒にテーブルに座っていた。14歳のトーマス。13歳のグレゴリー。そして11歳のミーガンだ。クローバーはテーブルの下で私の足にじゃれついていた。アメリアは食事をテーブルに運んでいた。最初は夕食の匂いについて冗談を言ったんだった。思い出すよ。家族5人で笑いながら、みんなでテーブルについていたんだ。幸せだった。団欒を過ごしていたんだ。それも長くはなかった。匂いがどんどん強くなって、すぐに何かがおかしいと気づいたからだ。 I was just about to give voice to my concerns when we heard the first screams.

何が起こったか知るのにもう耐えられない。辛すぎるんだ。だが、まとめよう。

私は剣を取った。剣は私の分しかなかったから、子供達は護身のために庭道具を掴んだ。そして私たちは夜に出た。危険を冒してでも家を守るために。 In the dying evening light I could make out Constance, my neighbors wife, on the far end of my field, struggling with a group of attackers as she tried to make it to the safety of my home. 私はなぜ彼女が家を去ったのか、夫のマキーアがどこにいたのか疑問に思った。

私は息子たちに扉の前で待つように言いつけ庭へ出た。クローバーは横についてきていた。やつらは彼女を囲んで引き倒していたが、私はこういう時は一番近くの者の首を斬りおとせば連中の戦意を喪失させられると知っていてそうするつもりで、マキーアと合流するまでやつらと膠着状態におこうとしていた。そこでやつらが彼女の服だけでなく肉を引き裂くのを見たのだ。私が彼女を助けようと近づく前にやつらは彼女の胃を引き裂き腸を引きずり出していた。彼女は今までに聞いたこともないような叫びをあげていた、だが私はこれ以来何度も聞くことになるのだ。私は恐怖で立ちすくみ動けなかった。やつらの一部は彼女の腸を食べ始めたが、他のやつらはまるでショーを楽しむように観ているかのようだった。私は動けなかった。そしてここにきて初めて彼女を殺したやつらを見たのだ。いくらかは普通の人間に見えていた。だが他のやつらの体は欠けていた。別のやつらは自分の腸をぶら下げていた。さらに別のやつらは墓から掘り返され新しい命を吹き込まれ、まるで生まれ変わっていたかのようだったよ。腐って悪臭を放ち、体のどこかの肉が腐敗してぶら下げていた。その眼孔は空だった。私は立ったまま嘔吐し、ズボンとブーツをびちゃびちゃにしてしまった。コンスタンスは叫んでいた。正気を失っているような叫びだった。眼が見えなくなった苦痛で。

クローバーは乱闘に向かって吠え、唸りながら走り始めた。彼は私が首を斬り落とそうとしていた一番近くのやつに飛び掛り、すぐ傍に突き飛ばした。私は彼に何が起こったか見ることが出来なかったが、その叫びで十分だった。いい犬だった。あれほど忠実にするには子犬の頃から育てなければならない。あれほどいい犬を育てるには、とても時間がかかるだろう。昨日のように思い出すよ。

I finally turned and began running back to my home where my boys stood with scythes and sickles just outside the door. I'd left Constance screaming, bleeding out into my wheat. Clover as well. I felt no guilt. My only thought was of my family. I ordered my boys in and told them to lock down everything. Doors were barred, shutters were locked. Barricades were set up. I tried to explain the situation to them but probably didn't make much sense. What about the situation did I really understand? I saw my Amelia eyeing the vomit on my boots, which were giving off an acidic smell. Saw the horror on her face as she realized the extent of the danger. I ordered her and Meagan upstairs to hide. My reasoning being that if the locks and barricades were unsuccessful, if my boys and I failed, we could still retreat upstairs. We could exit through a window and drop down the porch's overhang and flee into the night. My wife wanted for all of us to hide in the cellar. In my head, I was going to protect our home. I know now the home was irrelevant, and those in the home were everything. I'm sure I knew it then too, but pride was in the way of clear thinking. Fear also. Looking back, I wonder if they would still be alive if we had done what Amelia wanted. My dear sweet Amelia, missing half her face. 

At the time it must have felt like a heroic battle. My boys and I defending the home. My wife and daughter safe upstairs. I was an idiot. I don't know how long it took them to break in. Minutes probably. They surrounded the house and began pummeling doors and windows, breaking through sturdy wood and iron latches. Much of my rage and adrenaline dissipated when the first arm reached through the broken window shutters. I sliced it off cleanly at the elbow and did not faze the attacker in the least. My boys eyes grew wide in fear. Suddenly arms were everywhere. Reaching in, pulling boards out. Sword, sickle and scythe swinging with abandon. Limbs and blood and gore covering everything, soaking into the floorboards. And still they pressed on. Nothing would deter them. 

I realized it was a futile effort and was just about to enact our retreat and forfeit the house when one of them grabbed Gregory, my youngest. I heard him yell and turned to look just in time to see two of the attackers wrench his head from his shoulders. I went numb. I stood there, seeing but not understanding. It was Amelia who reacted. She saw from the top of the stairs. She ran down the narrow flight and shot across the room with unbelievable speed, stole Gregory's head away from the two undead leaning through our window, and began trying to re-attach it to his lifeless body. It may sound absurd, but it was more than I could do. I was still standing where I was, watching the horror unfold around me. I could hear weeping. I could hear her telling Gregory it would be ok. I saw the hands reaching for her from behind. Hands that belonged to Makii of all people. He was dead. One of his eyes was missing. There was a line of drool hanging from his mouth. One of his hands reached into her mouth, grabbed on for all it was worth and began pulling with inhuman strength. 

As half her face and scalp were pulled away, the paralysis finally broke. I ran to her and pulled her away from the rancid things invading our home, one of whom was my neighbor. I had helped him deliver a calf, for god's sake. And now as I looked back he slowly brought the scrap of Amelia's beautiful face and hair to his mouth and began chewing. I carried her upstairs yelling for Thomas to follow me. I remember him asking about Gregory but I don't remember answering him. I remember carrying Amelia down the hall and into our bedroom, Thomas and Meagan close behind. I remember locking and barricading our door while my two remaining children looked after their mother who was fading fast. 

“What do I do?”, Thomas yelled. I had no answer for him. I knelt down before her and held her hands. She looked at me and I have no idea if she really saw me, but there was an intensity in her eyes like she was trying to convey something. It could just be wishful thinking. Like I said, she was fading fast, bleeding out. There were no final words. No “I love you”. Just coughing and gurgling blood and sputtering. And that look in her eyes. Then she was gone. Just gone. An exhale and no inhale following it. Meagan began crying. Thomas looked to me to see what to do, but again I had no answer for him. My wife was dead on the floor in front of me. My youngest son dead downstairs. I had no answers. 

That was when the pounding on the door began. I knew we didn't have long. I began to prepare for our escape, quickly gathering a few items we would need on the road. They began to tear through the wood and I moved to push the dresser back in place reinforcing it, yelling for my children to grab the few items I'd gathered and climb out the window. That was when Amelia woke up. It was not Amelia anymore of course. But I didn't know that. For the briefest of moments I was so happy. I had been wrong. She wasn't dead after all. Then she grabbed Meagan and buried her ruined face into Meagan's neck and began chewing. With a large chunk of Meagan's flesh between her teeth, she jerked her head back violently, ripping tendon, tissue, and the carotid artery. Blood sprayed the room with an unbelievable pressure. Thomas was drenched in it. I began to scream “No”! It was all I seemed capable of. Repeating it over and over. 

I moved to pull Meagan away from Amelia and my wife began to growl at me. I threw Meagan in Thomas's arms telling him to back up, which of course was terrible advice. I turned to face my wife. I could see in her eyes it was no longer her. There was nothing but an evil hatred emanating from them. I understood what had to be done. Thomas did not. I took up my sword and brought it down through her skull, separating the half of her face with skin from the half without. Thomas began screaming. I stood there panting and turned to face Thomas just in time to see hands burst through the door he had backed up against and grab him. He dropped Meagan and screamed as he was pulled though the broken door. I rushed to look through the doorway but already the hall was too crowded with the undead to see him. But I could hear just fine as they were eating him alive. Screaming for me to help him for what seemed an eternity. That word will haunt me for as long as I go on. Dad. Screamed though the lips of a son I could not help. Over and over. I recall the first time he said dad when he was learning to talk. It was the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard.

No idea why I climbed out the window, dropped to the ground and ran away. But run away I did. It's all a blur. I really don't remember any other details until waking up in my brother Isaac's home just outside Whiterun two days later.

&lt;b&gt;Draman&lt;/b&gt;
As it is know The Dragons Reward some of their loyal men with Power, Which Makes Them turn into Dragon Priests, But, it has been Recently Discovered That The Dragons Can Also Turn some of their men into Foul Creatures.
 
These Creatures Are Named as DovahMun , More Known as Draman.
They Resemble The Dragons Themselves, But they are Biped and do not Fly.
Their Size Can Vary Depending On The Creature's Own Power.

It Has Been Confirmed That The Draman Guard Specific Places, Ordered By The Dragons. They Guard Most, if not all Dragon Mounds. They Attack Almost Any Living Creatures. Many Draman Have Been Killed.

We Fear that There Will be no end to the Draman If the Dragons Are Not Dealt With.

Much Like Dragons, Draman Have Variants too, It Depends Of what Dragon has Rewarded him with his Power.

&lt;b&gt;Seen Draman Variants so far:&lt;/b&gt;
Fire, Frost and Force. Their Powers can Be Strong or weak, Depending on Their own Strength of Course. They Also Carry Weapons like Bows, Swords and Axes.

This is all We, The Blades, Know about the Draman so far.

&lt;b&gt;竜人&lt;/b&gt;
ドラゴンが高貴な人物にその力を与えるということは知られており、それは人がドラゴン・プリーストになるということでもある。しかし、ドラゴンが人々をまた醜い生き物へと変化させることが最近になって判明した。
 
これらの生き物はドヴァムンと呼ばれ、また竜人とも呼ばれる。
彼らはドラゴンに似ているが、二足歩行を行い、飛ぶことはできない。
彼らの大きさは彼ら自身の力そのものを体現しており、さまざまである。

また、竜人がドラゴンの指示により特定の場所を守護しているということが分かっている。彼らはドラゴンの墓などを守るだけでない。彼らは生き物を攻撃することもある。そのせいで、多くの竜人が殺されたのである。

ドラゴンが何かしら対処をしない限り、竜人は常に現れつづけるであろう、これは大変な恐怖である。

ドラゴンのように、竜人にも様々な種類があることがわかっている。それはドラゴンが竜人に与えた力によるようだ。

&lt;b&gt;これまでに観測された竜人の種類:&lt;/b&gt;
炎、氷、そして揺ぎ無い力。これらのパワーは竜人によって強弱がある。また弓や剣や斧のような武器を装備していることがある。

少ないながら、これが我々ブレイズが知っている竜人についてのすべてである。

A Triple Tragedy: The Tale of the Falmilgaar Family

A Love Lost (Book 2/3)


&lt;/p&gt;



[pagebreak]
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
&lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/M_letter.png'&gt;uch time had passed since the passing of his parents. Balthorn along with his brother had devoted themselves to an art of fighting they invented themselves-an art so effective that they began creating a reputation amongst the community of the night-one to be feared, and local inns were starting to tell tall tales of their exploits.  It filled them with pride, but Balthorn in his heart desired to settle down.  He did desire to put his past behind him-but he was a prisoner of his own fate as you shall soon see. . .
Smoke from a village could be seen from a distance, as one approached closer, one could see the remains of a massacre.  Blood splattered the dirt road, limbs were scattered about as if a once completed puzzle was tossed about in a rage.  The scent of death filled the air.  A horse hoof stomped down on a singed sign.  The rider rode proud and seemed larger than life itself.  His confident aura changed the scene.  Balthorn, slowly road through the town looking for any survivors and as he surveyed the scene he came across a few mutilated bodies with wounds in their necks.  “Vampires” he spoke under his breath. Shortly after saying this, a cry (a literal cry) for help could be heard off in the distance.
“Help me!” the shout grew louder.  Out from behind a dilapidated shack came a young attractive woman that looked to be between the ages of 27 to 30-close to Balthorn’s own age.  The girl asked the stranger who he was and he answered her, “Balthorn”.  She pleaded for help from the capable looking stranger and told him her story:  the thieves’ guild snuck into their small village during the previous night and unlocked the doors and windows to all the homes.  They helped themselves to whatever they could fit in their pouches and worse yet, let a group of vampires into the homes so they could feed.  One of the townsmen awoke during the feeding and fought off the vampire and jumped out of his window.  He started yelling for help which awoke the entire little village and a huge fight took place.  The townsfolk were outnumbered and out matched, the thieves and the vampires made quick work of the tenants and the vampires fed like they were rabid beast.  She escaped to the wooded area that surrounded their quant village.  She stayed in hiding out of fear for her life until she saw the young lad who sat mounted on the horse in front of her.
This brought back painful memories of his own child hood and the loss of his own mother and father and he volunteered to help the exhausted young lady.  Having spent his teen years practicing and creating a martial art that focused on joint manipulation, nerve strikes and swordsmanship with his brother, Wayrl, Balthorn felt quite prepared to handle any vampire menace.  The two brothers had a fighting style that easily overwhelmed the average bar brawling nord.  Further, he and his brother would challenge one another, almost nightly to an advance game of hide and seek.  They were honing their stealth skills knowing they were going to be hunting creatures that were faster and stronger than they were, and also that these monstrosities had very keen senses.  They practiced how to approach a team of this type of enemy without detection and after years devoting themselves to their fighting style and stealth movements, they became quite proficient at it.
Balthagor, and his attractive new acquaintance setup a temporary camp in a nearby cave.  “Give me time to devise a plan”, he told her.  She was grateful for his aid, “my name is Dagney” she told him and then she obliged him in setting camp. Being a brute does not mean one is not a gentleman and he showed her the respect a young lady deserves.  He gave her the space she needed during the next few days while he came up with a solution, and a solution he did come up with!  After a decent meal of deer which he had hunted down earlier in the day, he told her what he was planning on doing.  “The alliance of the thieves’ guild and vampires must be broken down in order to weaken both sides.  As long as they have each other we are at a disadvantage.  I will need you for this plan to work if you are willing?”  Dagney was eager to avenge the death of her family and readily agreed.  “We shall seek out the thieves’ guild in Riften” he told her, “you shall infiltrate the guild and become one of them.  They are already aware of who I am so you’ll need to go alone.  They hang out in the Ratway.  Once you have established your place amongst them and earn their trust, you will bait them.  You’ll suggest a raid and that shall be their trap.  We’ll make it seem as though the thieves’ have grown tired of their treaty with the vampires and feel they are strong enough now to prowl on their own.”  Dagney eagerly interrupted, “the vampires will be furious!  They will then begin hunting the thieves and maybe even divert their immediate actions in a grand retaliation!” Balthorn in a calm manner nodded and stated a simple fact: “Smart girl.”  Dagney smiled as she just earned the respect of the seasoned hunter.
Dagney and Balthorn were successful at implementing their plan.  Months went by in order to assure Dagney was accepted as one of the members and did in fact gain their trust.  She had to be completely committed to the part and even aid in the robbing of the innocent in order to accomplish this task.  She was somewhat ashamed of herself and at the same time proud she was going to aid in the destruction of an alliance that nothing but evil could stem from-more importantly, aid in the direct attack against the very people who killed her family.  Further, Balthorn and Dagney were in a way growing closer.  He would frequently meet with her outside of Riften to check on her and ensure she was safe.  She never felt alone the entire time she was carrying out this clandestine operation.  When weeks would go by that he was unable to visit her, he would sneak in close to the Ratway at dusk and leave a single white rose lying where she would see it the next day.  This gave her the confidence she needed.  And to Balthorn, he was considering the fact that this confident and brave young woman may-just maybe-be an acceptable lifelong companion.
While Dagney was involved in her own mission, Balthorn was seeking out a local legend that would greatly aid him in dispatching the many foes he would soon to be up against.  The legend was of “Hurlevent” a word meaning stormwind.  This was a legendary blade that belonged to the family of the Stormbringer line of swords.  This type of sword was very rare and bound with a soul gem of a daemon.  The daemon’s soul cursed the blade and whatever the blade struck into; it was capable of “drinking” the soul of its enemy.  It was an ebony blade inscribed with runic text that held the bound soul enslaved to the blade.  Very few swords like this existed, the greater known of this type of sword was the Stormbringer and Hurlevent was its sister blade.  Hurlevent was forged by a warlock named, Majuro, whom imbued this blade to act as the ultimate weapon which could absorb souls to soul gems to aid in his necromancy.  This blade was said to be hidden in the Ruin of Angarvunde which lies to the west of Riften.  A blade that can pierce through any armor and drink the soul of its victims seemed like just the sword Balthorn would need to successfully dispatch the enemies he was about to show himself too.
He sought after the blade in Angarvunde and using the sneaking and stealth skills he and his brother perfected was able to maneuver around the ruins fairly undetected.  The Ruin had Draugr which would aid nicely when the time came to spring the trap on the vampire vermin and thief rats.  During his exploits in a crypt deep within the ruin, a decaying corpse lay near the exit.  The room was dark and the pathetic torches on the walls were not doing too great a job in lighting the place.  Balthorn took a silent step and heard a slow moan, “That can’t be good” he thought to himself.  Right after thinking this a cold hand laid itself down on his left shoulder and began pulling him toward the darkness.  He immediately reacted: he turned inward quickly and used his momentum to shove the draugr back. He was now face to face with an ugly menace that looked as if though it had seen hell itself and cursed to represent it in physical form.  He kicked the Draugr in the left knee quickly which broke the leg.  The Draugr stumbled to the left, Balthorn slid to the right of the Draugr creating enough distance that the Draugr was unable to reach him-perfectly executed.  He drew his silver sword (which was given to him from a friend of his father’s after the funeral) and quickly struck down on the left side of the Draugr but the Draugr evaded!  The creature stuck in between two worlds lunged with its broken leg toward the skilled hunter.  
Balthorn leaned back and intercepted the Draugr’s arm that was reaching for him and guided the Draugr toward a torch hanging on the wall behind him while he dashed to the side again.  The Draugr smashed into the wall and when he turned around quickly to face the seasoned fighter, he was met with another sword slash that took off his arm.  Balthorn always preferred being the aggressor in a fight-a tactic he and his brother practiced whole heartedly.  He rushed the draugr slamming his sword into his chest with such force that the blade jammed into the wall behind him.  Balthorn grabbed the torch and while the draugr was stuck, he held the torch to the draugr’s face and lit him ablaze.  Balthorn knowing that a lit corpse would easily draw attention scurried off with his sword and hid back into the shadows.
	He continued with his adventure in the ruin and at last reached a wide opened room.  He quietly explored further in and saw several Draugr sleeping in small chambers which was supposed to be their final resting place.  In the center of the room a whirling wind sound could be heard and a glowing aura was swirling around a blade floating in the air.  Sure enough the legend was true-he had found Hurlevent.  But could this be?  A sword of such great power guarded by only draugr?  He knew his plan of action, he would lead the thieves down here with the vampires and once Dagney initiated a small civil war within the two parties the surrounding Draugr would awake and attack both vampires and thieves together.  It would be an ultimate deadly encounter of pure chaos.  While the chaos ensued, he would make his claim of the sword and once he held this weapon of pure power, he would dispatch any surrounding enemy.  He would let a few run for sure so each party would tell their comrades what took place.  This would plant the seeds of hate in both camps which would ultimately be the end of an alliance that has been held together for far too long-the perfect plan.
	Within a few days Balthorn was rested and prepared mentally and physically for the fight which was about to ensue.  He left a lily near the stone stair path that led up from the living quarters of Riften which was Dagney’s sign to invoke the plan of action.  She mentioned to the leader of the thieves’ guild, Sarlow that she had overheard of a party of adventurers that were seeking a legendary demon sword that could drink the very soul of its victims (the bait).  This intrigued Sarlow immensely.  He simply said “imagine what one could do with a treasure like that!”  Dagney continued to taunt the leader’s greed. She said to him she had a plan.  The party she was witness to was fairly large and obviously veterans.  She wasn’t sure that with the minimalistic weapons the thieves had that they were going to be any match for them.  However, with the aid of the vampires they should be able to succeed in dispatching the party of heroes.  She continued “we should tell the vampires that this party, we suspect will attempt to invade the Ratway and oust our guild, we will need their help in preventing this and have baited the adventurers to go into Angarvunde with stories of treasures.  Once they are trapped inside, we along with the vampires will sneak in behind and attack them.  The vampires don’t ever have to know about the real cause of our being there and their “pay off” will be that the vampires keep any treasure this party has.”
Sarlow thought through this plan and decided he very much liked it; in fact he even offered her a promoted rank within the guild if this was able to be pulled off.  He was quite impressed with the thought out details of her ingenious scheme.  (If only he knew that this scheme was much deeper, and that he was just a pawn on a chess board that had been beautifully setup for a check and mate.)  He told her he would send word to the vampires and that she should begin readying the guild-they would be ready to leave within a few days.  They would let the adventures delve into the ruins first and then follow suit. 
	The couple days passed and everyone was ready.  The vampires and the thieves were being led to the ruin by Dagney who had supposedly kept an eye on the adventurers (that didn’t really exist).  The draugr were resting inside their chambers guarding the legendary artifact and Balthorn was already inside Angarvunde patiently waiting for his cue to strike. Dagney led the party of unsuspecting thugs and blood suckers down into the ruins and any cursed monsters were quickly dispatched by thieve bowmen or by the pure evil power of the vampires.  The ruin was windy and full of dark, dank tunnels.  It wreaked of the rotting dead and the noises that echoed off in the distance was enough to make a man go mad.  Finally however, they reached their destination,  a map that Balthorn gave Dagney a few nights before was exact and aided her greatly in her finding of this treasure room.  All the pieces were in their proper place.  The game was about to begin. . .
	After the thieves and vampires entered the main chamber the vampires could instantly sense the energy which was emitting from the blade floating in the air.  Their keen sense warned them of its power.  Dagney made her way to the side and very loudly shouted “Guild, they’re here!  Attack now!”  Both parties drew weapons though they were confused as neither knew what was taking place.  She continued with her propaganda, “Kill the vampires!  Kill them!  No longer are we under their rule!” Shortly after this a silver arrow (shot by a hidden Balthorn) landed right between the eyes of a blood sucker-killing him instantly.  That was all the vampires needed to see, they immediately attacked the thieves which were of course retaliating for their lives.  All the shouting and fighting commencing had in fact awakened the draugr which hungered for anything alive or dead to eat.  Dagney tried her best to evade the massive slaughter that was taking place around her and make her escape out of the ruin while Balthorn made haste to his self-proclaimed prize.
	He dashed in and out of people locked in combat and slid jabs and cuts in where he needed to in order to buy enough time to get the blade.  He ran his way up the stair case and felt a deadly chill pierce through his body as he passed the aura that was circling Hurlevent.  He reached for the sword.  A vampire took notice of this and quickly recognized the blackened armor clad Balthorn.  He was the hunter that had been responsible for the many deaths of many vampire brothers.  He wore a unique armor that was easily recognizable.  It was sort of a trademark, a sign to be noticed-a warning to all.  The vampire yelled in a frightened and panicked voice, “Grab that blade!”  While still locked in combat, many of the lesser skilled combatants did look towards the top of the chamber to witness a black knight grabbing the floating sword.  However, since they took their eyes of their opponents, they were fairly quickly dispatched.
	Balthorn’s hand grabbed the sword and as soon as he had a grip on it, the chamber began to shake and a low rumble could be heard echoing throughout the whole ruin.  A mass amount of unknown energy swirled behind the place the blade was hovering in and a low lit mist looking energy began to take on a very distinctive shape-that of a daedra!  (So there is the guardian to the blade.)  With the adrenaline rushing through his veins and his heart pounding to the clashing of iron and steel behind him, he didn’t need even a moment to respond to his unexpected circumstance and swung Hurlevent into the forming daedra.  Success!  His strike damaged the power that was forming the evil being and weakened the metamorphosis.  Still, the daedra continued to form and a weapon being unsheathed was visible.  Balthorn quickly rushed the entity backwards and sliced upwards towards the daedra damaging it and then using the momentum he had expelled, drove the blade back down in a diagonal motion cutting the daedra right as he was finishing materializing.
	The daedra fell back to his knee and looked confused and agitated as he could feel his physical essence being drained by the cursed blade.  He let out a growl as he once again materialized into a ghostly form and light emerged from his body.  Multiple beams of energy ejected out of him and flew into the blade that Balthorn was holding.  Quickly Balthorn pivoted around to see a couple thugs and a vampire rushing him. 
He immediately threw his silver sword into the air towards the thug on his most right side.  He took a quick step in the direction of the thug and began a spinning pivot holding his new sword near his waste creating a very powerful slashing motion that cut the thug into two splitting the torso from the legs.  He reached up in time to grab his silver sword in the air and finishing his spin executing a double wielding kill move where he drove both swords down in a crossed “X” decapitating the head of the second thug.  He then proceeded to throw the silver sword at the vampire who was jumping at him and managed to pierce the body but missing the heart.  He tucked and rolled to the side of the vampire as the creature landed on its side-unable to land properly from being wounded in the air.  Balthorn quickly stood to his feet and jumped towards the vampire slamming Hurlevent down into the creature’s heart upon landing.  A low rumble could again be heard as streaks of light emitted from the vampire’s body and entered into the blade.  
	Balthorn glanced up and saw a small army before him clashed in battle: vampires fighting draugr, while defending against thieves at the same time.  Thieves scattering about trying to stay alive while engaged in a battle for their own lives against the dead.  The draugr protecting their ruins and attempting to feast for the first time in only God knows how many years.  He took it all in and felt an overwhelming desire to slam the blade down to the ground.  He heard a voice echo inside his head, “release me…”.  The voice continued and although he didn’t want to, it was as if his arm was possessed and as the voice commanded him, he slammed the sword down into the stone slab beneath him.  At that very moment a blindingly bright light burst out of the runic text inscribed on the sword and circled around the room.  It was as if though a sun had been born from the darkness of the blade.  A low rumbling growl mimicking the sound of an angry lion echoed from around the demonic sword.  It was the raw power of the spirit of the daedra being forced out of the sword in a focused attack.  The daedra are burdened to take lives and this daedra had only little time in its physical form and therefore unable to feel satisfied since it was unable to claim lives.  Before it was forced to return to Oblivion it harnessed itself into a mass of energy to claim as many lives as it could before dissipating.
	The thieves were unable to see and the vampires’ pale skin was beginning to burn.  The draugr were slowly melting and the grotesque display of their skin falling off their cracked bones was a sickening site to behold.  Though many of them were killed by the arcane blast of the daedra they were not all dead.  Balthorn rushed into the midst of battle.  A thief caught glimpse of him and blindly started swinging his sword outward.  Balthorn dodged the random swinging and trapped the brigands arm by wrapping his left arm around his elbow-a joint lock which extended the brigands arm all the way out and caused the inside of the elbow to face outward.  He then pulled down on the wrist with his right hand which broke the elbow of the brigand.  The brigand’s scream of pain was loud but interrupted quickly with a blood gurgling sound.  The brigands own sword was just thrust through his chest since the breaking of his elbow made him drop his blade.  Balthorn was posed in proper stance as he continued running the brigand’s own sword through his body. He then began to run forward causing the brigand to struggle by keeping up running backwards.  The skilled hunter had targeted a vampire that was behind the brigand and pierced into the vampire with the tip of the sword that was protruding out of the back of the brigand.  Balthorn released the handle of the sword and snapped the neck of the thief that was crying in front of him.  He then grabbed the handle of the sword again and quickly jerked the sword out, as the thief’s body dropped down in front of the vampire the sword was once again thrust into the air and pierced through the neck of the glowing-eyed demon.  While the vampire struggled with his pierced neck, Balthorn pulled out a silver tipped steak which was tied around the thigh of his armor and drove it into the vampire’s chest.
	After a loud growl was let out, Balthorn dropped to his knees and rolled out of the way of a melting draugr attack.  Balthorn reached up as he stood up and grabbed a rib of the draugr and spun beside the draugr ripping the rib out from his left side and shoving into the temple area of his right side-the draugr dropped dead and continued falling apart on the floor. At this time, a bandit and vampire both targeted Balthorn.  The vampire raised his right hand in the air and a force of red blood magic began to materialize around our hero.  The energy rode on a slight draft within the ruin and flowed into the vampire himself (he was stealing Balthorn’s life force).  While this took place the determined brigand quickly disarmed the seasoned hunter displacing Hurlevent and causing it to fall to the floor.  The brigand continued to fight against the dazed Balthorn and eventually got the best of him and caused him to stumble backward and land on the floor.  However, this apparent victory was the very action that would save Balthorn.  As he fell backwards, he was no longer under pressure of the vampire’s blood magic spell which was draining him.  He quickly rolled over on the floor towards the brigand.  He reached around the brigand’s leg trapping it with his left forearm and with his right elbow pushed in the front of the thief’s shin bone causing his back forearm to cut into the nerve that is located behind the leg.  The brigand stumbled backwards and Balthorn quickly crawled up on over him and open palm struck him in the nose causing the bone to lodge itself into his enemy’s brain.  He glanced up and saw the vampire running toward him as well as his sword lying on the floor.  He dashed toward his newly found weapon and using the tip of his boot kicked the sword up in the air towards his right hand.  As he was able to grab hold of the base of Hurlevent he jumped toward the vampire with blade extended.  The tip of the blade cut into the top of the vampire’s skull and with the momentum of the jump he had acquired, he continued to force the blade clean through all the way down to the vampire’s groin-splitting him in two as he landed.
Balthorn continued to use his specialized skill and finished off what there was inside that ruin.  He stood in the middle of the main chamber breathing heavily and sheathing his new weapon.  He stood for moments to rest from an enduring battle and was interrupted by a strange sound coming from outside the main chamber.  He summoned what energy he had left and went to see what the source of the disturbing sound was.  It was Dagney!  She was unable to avoid the combat as she had tried to do and was leaning up against the wall outside the chamber.  She was in bad shape, her legs were cut, and her arms had blood running down from her shoulders onto her fingers.  Her eyes met with Balthorn’s and displayed such a tiredness that showed she was ready to give up on life.  What were even worse were the wounds on the right side of her neck that Balthorn noticed.
	He stroked her hair gently as he kneeled beside her.  She was too weak to even speak.  They both knew what was about to happen.  She was already dead looking, she had taken too many wounds and so much spilled vampire blood was covering her that the change was already beginning to take place (normally two or three days is what it takes for the cursed disease of Sanguinare Vampiris &lt;http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Sanguinare_Vampiris&gt; to take full affect).  She looked at him calmly.  She had her vengeance and could die happy now, she smiled. Further, she was in the arms of the one man she had come to love over the past few months.  He pulled out a dagger. . .  She reached her bloody arm up to his face and gently stroked his cheek with her finger.  He put the dagger against her throat. . .  She gently rested her head against his bicep and closed her eyes.  There they both waited in the dark.  It was only moments but it felt like forever.  Neither said a word to the other, she was too worn out and he was preparing to commit the cold act of mercy.  Her whole body went limp, a single tear rolled down his cheek and again he waited-it wasn’t quite time yet.  What was he waiting for?  Her body jerked quickly, and then it stopped.  He felt a second jerk, this time more violent than the first.  Now, it was time.  The girl he had begun falling in love with was truly no longer occupying her body, now a monster was awaking inside of her.  He was skilled enough that he knew exactly where to cut.  It was quick and all she could feel was a prick piercing her skin, followed by tiredness (the only pain felt was emotional and this was endured by Balthorn).  She slowly opened her eyes and nodded as if to say “thank you”.  Shortly after that, her eyes rolled up and her breathing became fainter and fainter-then suddenly it stopped.
	He took her in his arms and carried her outside of the ruin.  As luck would have it, it was raining outside now.  He gently set her down and began digging a whole with his hands.  Half an hour or so went by and the hole was large enough to place Dagney into-which he did.  He covered her and out of the corner of his eye he saw a single white rose.  She set it there as she was entering the ruin.  She must have known that she may not make it out alive. He took the rose and grasped it in his hand.  He squeezed it as he was squeezing her hand.  A moment passed and his proud posture stooped down.  He leaned over and placed the rose on her grave.  He stood again and was silent as he watched the rain pour down.  If he were shedding any tears the rain was hiding it.  After a few minutes had passed a wagon being pulled by a large horse was passing by and all of a sudden upon seeing him it stopped.  A head popped out of the door of the wagon and asked if he needed a lift.  He gently shook his head back and forth and in a low tone said “I’d prefer to walk”.  The man in the wagon looked confused and said "you are a strange one, what’s your name?  I insist you let me give you a ride in this weather, stranger”.  Balthorn paused for a moment.  He looked down toward where Dagney laid rest, he remembered the heartache and horror he suffered as a child during his parents attack, he felt sickened to proudly claim a name that had seen so much death with, and a name he was planning to share with the woman he buried earlier.  He then recalled the fear in the vampire’s voice inside the ruin as it shouted “grab that blade!”  He liked that, he liked the way the vampire sounded afraid-trembling.  He looked back at the man in the wagon and in a low tone stated “I’m Blade….and I’ll walk.”
	Balthorn’s genius plan was a success.  The few members of the two parties that were able to escape reported to their respectful camps what had taken place.  According to the vampires, the thieves had attacked them and they were unsure if the thieves hired Balthorn as a mercenary to aid them.  To the thieves’ guild, confusion was spread amongst them as the leaders of the raid were dead now and unable to shed any light on the occurrences-they were just unsure of what happened and why it took place.  They knew this however, the vampires were quick to attack them and a black knight with fighting skills unlike anything they’ve seen before made off with their treasure.  The alliance was broken.
 Many days had passed and Balthorn was restructuring his armor outside a small abode he owned.  He was hardening it, adding to it-perfecting it.  He looked up and saw the sun setting, a time most nords try not to tread outside.  If anyone was around they would have sworn they caught a glimpse of a smile cross his face.  It was not a satisfied smile; no, it was a smile that belonged on the face of a man who was destined to change his world.  This is the story of triumph, of a love lost, this is the story of a man who could see clearly now his sole purpose in life, this is the story of… Blade.

A Triple Tragedy: The Tale of the Falmilgaar Family

A Love Lost (Book 2/3)


&lt;/p&gt;



[pagebreak]
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
&lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/M_letter.png'&gt;uch time had passed since the passing of his parents. Balthorn along with his brother had devoted themselves to an art of fighting they invented themselves-an art so effective that they began creating a reputation amongst the community of the night-one to be feared, and local inns were starting to tell tall tales of their exploits.  It filled them with pride, but Balthorn in his heart desired to settle down.  He did desire to put his past behind him-but he was a prisoner of his own fate as you shall soon see. . .
Smoke from a village could be seen from a distance, as one approached closer, one could see the remains of a massacre.  Blood splattered the dirt road, limbs were scattered about as if a once completed puzzle was tossed about in a rage.  The scent of death filled the air.  A horse hoof stomped down on a singed sign.  The rider rode proud and seemed larger than life itself.  His confident aura changed the scene.  Balthorn, slowly road through the town looking for any survivors and as he surveyed the scene he came across a few mutilated bodies with wounds in their necks.  “Vampires” he spoke under his breath. Shortly after saying this, a cry (a literal cry) for help could be heard off in the distance.
“Help me!” the shout grew louder.  Out from behind a dilapidated shack came a young attractive woman that looked to be between the ages of 27 to 30-close to Balthorn’s own age.  The girl asked the stranger who he was and he answered her, “Balthorn”.  She pleaded for help from the capable looking stranger and told him her story:  the thieves’ guild snuck into their small village during the previous night and unlocked the doors and windows to all the homes.  They helped themselves to whatever they could fit in their pouches and worse yet, let a group of vampires into the homes so they could feed.  One of the townsmen awoke during the feeding and fought off the vampire and jumped out of his window.  He started yelling for help which awoke the entire little village and a huge fight took place.  The townsfolk were outnumbered and out matched, the thieves and the vampires made quick work of the tenants and the vampires fed like they were rabid beast.  She escaped to the wooded area that surrounded their quant village.  She stayed in hiding out of fear for her life until she saw the young lad who sat mounted on the horse in front of her.
This brought back painful memories of his own child hood and the loss of his own mother and father and he volunteered to help the exhausted young lady.  Having spent his teen years practicing and creating a martial art that focused on joint manipulation, nerve strikes and swordsmanship with his brother, Wayrl, Balthorn felt quite prepared to handle any vampire menace.  The two brothers had a fighting style that easily overwhelmed the average bar brawling nord.  Further, he and his brother would challenge one another, almost nightly to an advance game of hide and seek.  They were honing their stealth skills knowing they were going to be hunting creatures that were faster and stronger than they were, and also that these monstrosities had very keen senses.  They practiced how to approach a team of this type of enemy without detection and after years devoting themselves to their fighting style and stealth movements, they became quite proficient at it.
Balthagor, and his attractive new acquaintance setup a temporary camp in a nearby cave.  “Give me time to devise a plan”, he told her.  She was grateful for his aid, “my name is Dagney” she told him and then she obliged him in setting camp. Being a brute does not mean one is not a gentleman and he showed her the respect a young lady deserves.  He gave her the space she needed during the next few days while he came up with a solution, and a solution he did come up with!  After a decent meal of deer which he had hunted down earlier in the day, he told her what he was planning on doing.  “The alliance of the thieves’ guild and vampires must be broken down in order to weaken both sides.  As long as they have each other we are at a disadvantage.  I will need you for this plan to work if you are willing?”  Dagney was eager to avenge the death of her family and readily agreed.  “We shall seek out the thieves’ guild in Riften” he told her, “you shall infiltrate the guild and become one of them.  They are already aware of who I am so you’ll need to go alone.  They hang out in the Ratway.  Once you have established your place amongst them and earn their trust, you will bait them.  You’ll suggest a raid and that shall be their trap.  We’ll make it seem as though the thieves’ have grown tired of their treaty with the vampires and feel they are strong enough now to prowl on their own.”  Dagney eagerly interrupted, “the vampires will be furious!  They will then begin hunting the thieves and maybe even divert their immediate actions in a grand retaliation!” Balthorn in a calm manner nodded and stated a simple fact: “Smart girl.”  Dagney smiled as she just earned the respect of the seasoned hunter.
Dagney and Balthorn were successful at implementing their plan.  Months went by in order to assure Dagney was accepted as one of the members and did in fact gain their trust.  She had to be completely committed to the part and even aid in the robbing of the innocent in order to accomplish this task.  She was somewhat ashamed of herself and at the same time proud she was going to aid in the destruction of an alliance that nothing but evil could stem from-more importantly, aid in the direct attack against the very people who killed her family.  Further, Balthorn and Dagney were in a way growing closer.  He would frequently meet with her outside of Riften to check on her and ensure she was safe.  She never felt alone the entire time she was carrying out this clandestine operation.  When weeks would go by that he was unable to visit her, he would sneak in close to the Ratway at dusk and leave a single white rose lying where she would see it the next day.  This gave her the confidence she needed.  And to Balthorn, he was considering the fact that this confident and brave young woman may-just maybe-be an acceptable lifelong companion.
While Dagney was involved in her own mission, Balthorn was seeking out a local legend that would greatly aid him in dispatching the many foes he would soon to be up against.  The legend was of “Hurlevent” a word meaning stormwind.  This was a legendary blade that belonged to the family of the Stormbringer line of swords.  This type of sword was very rare and bound with a soul gem of a daemon.  The daemon’s soul cursed the blade and whatever the blade struck into; it was capable of “drinking” the soul of its enemy.  It was an ebony blade inscribed with runic text that held the bound soul enslaved to the blade.  Very few swords like this existed, the greater known of this type of sword was the Stormbringer and Hurlevent was its sister blade.  Hurlevent was forged by a warlock named, Majuro, whom imbued this blade to act as the ultimate weapon which could absorb souls to soul gems to aid in his necromancy.  This blade was said to be hidden in the Ruin of Angarvunde which lies to the west of Riften.  A blade that can pierce through any armor and drink the soul of its victims seemed like just the sword Balthorn would need to successfully dispatch the enemies he was about to show himself too.
He sought after the blade in Angarvunde and using the sneaking and stealth skills he and his brother perfected was able to maneuver around the ruins fairly undetected.  The Ruin had Draugr which would aid nicely when the time came to spring the trap on the vampire vermin and thief rats.  During his exploits in a crypt deep within the ruin, a decaying corpse lay near the exit.  The room was dark and the pathetic torches on the walls were not doing too great a job in lighting the place.  Balthorn took a silent step and heard a slow moan, “That can’t be good” he thought to himself.  Right after thinking this a cold hand laid itself down on his left shoulder and began pulling him toward the darkness.  He immediately reacted: he turned inward quickly and used his momentum to shove the draugr back. He was now face to face with an ugly menace that looked as if though it had seen hell itself and cursed to represent it in physical form.  He kicked the Draugr in the left knee quickly which broke the leg.  The Draugr stumbled to the left, Balthorn slid to the right of the Draugr creating enough distance that the Draugr was unable to reach him-perfectly executed.  He drew his silver sword (which was given to him from a friend of his father’s after the funeral) and quickly struck down on the left side of the Draugr but the Draugr evaded!  The creature stuck in between two worlds lunged with its broken leg toward the skilled hunter.  
Balthorn leaned back and intercepted the Draugr’s arm that was reaching for him and guided the Draugr toward a torch hanging on the wall behind him while he dashed to the side again.  The Draugr smashed into the wall and when he turned around quickly to face the seasoned fighter, he was met with another sword slash that took off his arm.  Balthorn always preferred being the aggressor in a fight-a tactic he and his brother practiced whole heartedly.  He rushed the draugr slamming his sword into his chest with such force that the blade jammed into the wall behind him.  Balthorn grabbed the torch and while the draugr was stuck, he held the torch to the draugr’s face and lit him ablaze.  Balthorn knowing that a lit corpse would easily draw attention scurried off with his sword and hid back into the shadows.
	He continued with his adventure in the ruin and at last reached a wide opened room.  He quietly explored further in and saw several Draugr sleeping in small chambers which was supposed to be their final resting place.  In the center of the room a whirling wind sound could be heard and a glowing aura was swirling around a blade floating in the air.  Sure enough the legend was true-he had found Hurlevent.  But could this be?  A sword of such great power guarded by only draugr?  He knew his plan of action, he would lead the thieves down here with the vampires and once Dagney initiated a small civil war within the two parties the surrounding Draugr would awake and attack both vampires and thieves together.  It would be an ultimate deadly encounter of pure chaos.  While the chaos ensued, he would make his claim of the sword and once he held this weapon of pure power, he would dispatch any surrounding enemy.  He would let a few run for sure so each party would tell their comrades what took place.  This would plant the seeds of hate in both camps which would ultimately be the end of an alliance that has been held together for far too long-the perfect plan.
	Within a few days Balthorn was rested and prepared mentally and physically for the fight which was about to ensue.  He left a lily near the stone stair path that led up from the living quarters of Riften which was Dagney’s sign to invoke the plan of action.  She mentioned to the leader of the thieves’ guild, Sarlow that she had overheard of a party of adventurers that were seeking a legendary demon sword that could drink the very soul of its victims (the bait).  This intrigued Sarlow immensely.  He simply said “imagine what one could do with a treasure like that!”  Dagney continued to taunt the leader’s greed. She said to him she had a plan.  The party she was witness to was fairly large and obviously veterans.  She wasn’t sure that with the minimalistic weapons the thieves had that they were going to be any match for them.  However, with the aid of the vampires they should be able to succeed in dispatching the party of heroes.  She continued “we should tell the vampires that this party, we suspect will attempt to invade the Ratway and oust our guild, we will need their help in preventing this and have baited the adventurers to go into Angarvunde with stories of treasures.  Once they are trapped inside, we along with the vampires will sneak in behind and attack them.  The vampires don’t ever have to know about the real cause of our being there and their “pay off” will be that the vampires keep any treasure this party has.”
Sarlow thought through this plan and decided he very much liked it; in fact he even offered her a promoted rank within the guild if this was able to be pulled off.  He was quite impressed with the thought out details of her ingenious scheme.  (If only he knew that this scheme was much deeper, and that he was just a pawn on a chess board that had been beautifully setup for a check and mate.)  He told her he would send word to the vampires and that she should begin readying the guild-they would be ready to leave within a few days.  They would let the adventures delve into the ruins first and then follow suit. 
	The couple days passed and everyone was ready.  The vampires and the thieves were being led to the ruin by Dagney who had supposedly kept an eye on the adventurers (that didn’t really exist).  The draugr were resting inside their chambers guarding the legendary artifact and Balthorn was already inside Angarvunde patiently waiting for his cue to strike. Dagney led the party of unsuspecting thugs and blood suckers down into the ruins and any cursed monsters were quickly dispatched by thieve bowmen or by the pure evil power of the vampires.  The ruin was windy and full of dark, dank tunnels.  It wreaked of the rotting dead and the noises that echoed off in the distance was enough to make a man go mad.  Finally however, they reached their destination,  a map that Balthorn gave Dagney a few nights before was exact and aided her greatly in her finding of this treasure room.  All the pieces were in their proper place.  The game was about to begin. . .
	After the thieves and vampires entered the main chamber the vampires could instantly sense the energy which was emitting from the blade floating in the air.  Their keen sense warned them of its power.  Dagney made her way to the side and very loudly shouted “Guild, they’re here!  Attack now!”  Both parties drew weapons though they were confused as neither knew what was taking place.  She continued with her propaganda, “Kill the vampires!  Kill them!  No longer are we under their rule!” Shortly after this a silver arrow (shot by a hidden Balthorn) landed right between the eyes of a blood sucker-killing him instantly.  That was all the vampires needed to see, they immediately attacked the thieves which were of course retaliating for their lives.  All the shouting and fighting commencing had in fact awakened the draugr which hungered for anything alive or dead to eat.  Dagney tried her best to evade the massive slaughter that was taking place around her and make her escape out of the ruin while Balthorn made haste to his self-proclaimed prize.
	He dashed in and out of people locked in combat and slid jabs and cuts in where he needed to in order to buy enough time to get the blade.  He ran his way up the stair case and felt a deadly chill pierce through his body as he passed the aura that was circling Hurlevent.  He reached for the sword.  A vampire took notice of this and quickly recognized the blackened armor clad Balthorn.  He was the hunter that had been responsible for the many deaths of many vampire brothers.  He wore a unique armor that was easily recognizable.  It was sort of a trademark, a sign to be noticed-a warning to all.  The vampire yelled in a frightened and panicked voice, “Grab that blade!”  While still locked in combat, many of the lesser skilled combatants did look towards the top of the chamber to witness a black knight grabbing the floating sword.  However, since they took their eyes of their opponents, they were fairly quickly dispatched.
	Balthorn’s hand grabbed the sword and as soon as he had a grip on it, the chamber began to shake and a low rumble could be heard echoing throughout the whole ruin.  A mass amount of unknown energy swirled behind the place the blade was hovering in and a low lit mist looking energy began to take on a very distinctive shape-that of a daedra!  (So there is the guardian to the blade.)  With the adrenaline rushing through his veins and his heart pounding to the clashing of iron and steel behind him, he didn’t need even a moment to respond to his unexpected circumstance and swung Hurlevent into the forming daedra.  Success!  His strike damaged the power that was forming the evil being and weakened the metamorphosis.  Still, the daedra continued to form and a weapon being unsheathed was visible.  Balthorn quickly rushed the entity backwards and sliced upwards towards the daedra damaging it and then using the momentum he had expelled, drove the blade back down in a diagonal motion cutting the daedra right as he was finishing materializing.
	The daedra fell back to his knee and looked confused and agitated as he could feel his physical essence being drained by the cursed blade.  He let out a growl as he once again materialized into a ghostly form and light emerged from his body.  Multiple beams of energy ejected out of him and flew into the blade that Balthorn was holding.  Quickly Balthorn pivoted around to see a couple thugs and a vampire rushing him. 
He immediately threw his silver sword into the air towards the thug on his most right side.  He took a quick step in the direction of the thug and began a spinning pivot holding his new sword near his waste creating a very powerful slashing motion that cut the thug into two splitting the torso from the legs.  He reached up in time to grab his silver sword in the air and finishing his spin executing a double wielding kill move where he drove both swords down in a crossed “X” decapitating the head of the second thug.  He then proceeded to throw the silver sword at the vampire who was jumping at him and managed to pierce the body but missing the heart.  He tucked and rolled to the side of the vampire as the creature landed on its side-unable to land properly from being wounded in the air.  Balthorn quickly stood to his feet and jumped towards the vampire slamming Hurlevent down into the creature’s heart upon landing.  A low rumble could again be heard as streaks of light emitted from the vampire’s body and entered into the blade.  
	Balthorn glanced up and saw a small army before him clashed in battle: vampires fighting draugr, while defending against thieves at the same time.  Thieves scattering about trying to stay alive while engaged in a battle for their own lives against the dead.  The draugr protecting their ruins and attempting to feast for the first time in only God knows how many years.  He took it all in and felt an overwhelming desire to slam the blade down to the ground.  He heard a voice echo inside his head, “release me…”.  The voice continued and although he didn’t want to, it was as if his arm was possessed and as the voice commanded him, he slammed the sword down into the stone slab beneath him.  At that very moment a blindingly bright light burst out of the runic text inscribed on the sword and circled around the room.  It was as if though a sun had been born from the darkness of the blade.  A low rumbling growl mimicking the sound of an angry lion echoed from around the demonic sword.  It was the raw power of the spirit of the daedra being forced out of the sword in a focused attack.  The daedra are burdened to take lives and this daedra had only little time in its physical form and therefore unable to feel satisfied since it was unable to claim lives.  Before it was forced to return to Oblivion it harnessed itself into a mass of energy to claim as many lives as it could before dissipating.
	The thieves were unable to see and the vampires’ pale skin was beginning to burn.  The draugr were slowly melting and the grotesque display of their skin falling off their cracked bones was a sickening site to behold.  Though many of them were killed by the arcane blast of the daedra they were not all dead.  Balthorn rushed into the midst of battle.  A thief caught glimpse of him and blindly started swinging his sword outward.  Balthorn dodged the random swinging and trapped the brigands arm by wrapping his left arm around his elbow-a joint lock which extended the brigands arm all the way out and caused the inside of the elbow to face outward.  He then pulled down on the wrist with his right hand which broke the elbow of the brigand.  The brigand’s scream of pain was loud but interrupted quickly with a blood gurgling sound.  The brigands own sword was just thrust through his chest since the breaking of his elbow made him drop his blade.  Balthorn was posed in proper stance as he continued running the brigand’s own sword through his body. He then began to run forward causing the brigand to struggle by keeping up running backwards.  The skilled hunter had targeted a vampire that was behind the brigand and pierced into the vampire with the tip of the sword that was protruding out of the back of the brigand.  Balthorn released the handle of the sword and snapped the neck of the thief that was crying in front of him.  He then grabbed the handle of the sword again and quickly jerked the sword out, as the thief’s body dropped down in front of the vampire the sword was once again thrust into the air and pierced through the neck of the glowing-eyed demon.  While the vampire struggled with his pierced neck, Balthorn pulled out a silver tipped steak which was tied around the thigh of his armor and drove it into the vampire’s chest.
	After a loud growl was let out, Balthorn dropped to his knees and rolled out of the way of a melting draugr attack.  Balthorn reached up as he stood up and grabbed a rib of the draugr and spun beside the draugr ripping the rib out from his left side and shoving into the temple area of his right side-the draugr dropped dead and continued falling apart on the floor. At this time, a bandit and vampire both targeted Balthorn.  The vampire raised his right hand in the air and a force of red blood magic began to materialize around our hero.  The energy rode on a slight draft within the ruin and flowed into the vampire himself (he was stealing Balthorn’s life force).  While this took place the determined brigand quickly disarmed the seasoned hunter displacing Hurlevent and causing it to fall to the floor.  The brigand continued to fight against the dazed Balthorn and eventually got the best of him and caused him to stumble backward and land on the floor.  However, this apparent victory was the very action that would save Balthorn.  As he fell backwards, he was no longer under pressure of the vampire’s blood magic spell which was draining him.  He quickly rolled over on the floor towards the brigand.  He reached around the brigand’s leg trapping it with his left forearm and with his right elbow pushed in the front of the thief’s shin bone causing his back forearm to cut into the nerve that is located behind the leg.  The brigand stumbled backwards and Balthorn quickly crawled up on over him and open palm struck him in the nose causing the bone to lodge itself into his enemy’s brain.  He glanced up and saw the vampire running toward him as well as his sword lying on the floor.  He dashed toward his newly found weapon and using the tip of his boot kicked the sword up in the air towards his right hand.  As he was able to grab hold of the base of Hurlevent he jumped toward the vampire with blade extended.  The tip of the blade cut into the top of the vampire’s skull and with the momentum of the jump he had acquired, he continued to force the blade clean through all the way down to the vampire’s groin-splitting him in two as he landed.
Balthorn continued to use his specialized skill and finished off what there was inside that ruin.  He stood in the middle of the main chamber breathing heavily and sheathing his new weapon.  He stood for moments to rest from an enduring battle and was interrupted by a strange sound coming from outside the main chamber.  He summoned what energy he had left and went to see what the source of the disturbing sound was.  It was Dagney!  She was unable to avoid the combat as she had tried to do and was leaning up against the wall outside the chamber.  She was in bad shape, her legs were cut, and her arms had blood running down from her shoulders onto her fingers.  Her eyes met with Balthorn’s and displayed such a tiredness that showed she was ready to give up on life.  What were even worse were the wounds on the right side of her neck that Balthorn noticed.
	He stroked her hair gently as he kneeled beside her.  She was too weak to even speak.  They both knew what was about to happen.  She was already dead looking, she had taken too many wounds and so much spilled vampire blood was covering her that the change was already beginning to take place (normally two or three days is what it takes for the cursed disease of Sanguinare Vampiris &lt;http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Sanguinare_Vampiris&gt; to take full affect).  She looked at him calmly.  She had her vengeance and could die happy now, she smiled. Further, she was in the arms of the one man she had come to love over the past few months.  He pulled out a dagger. . .  She reached her bloody arm up to his face and gently stroked his cheek with her finger.  He put the dagger against her throat. . .  She gently rested her head against his bicep and closed her eyes.  There they both waited in the dark.  It was only moments but it felt like forever.  Neither said a word to the other, she was too worn out and he was preparing to commit the cold act of mercy.  Her whole body went limp, a single tear rolled down his cheek and again he waited-it wasn’t quite time yet.  What was he waiting for?  Her body jerked quickly, and then it stopped.  He felt a second jerk, this time more violent than the first.  Now, it was time.  The girl he had begun falling in love with was truly no longer occupying her body, now a monster was awaking inside of her.  He was skilled enough that he knew exactly where to cut.  It was quick and all she could feel was a prick piercing her skin, followed by tiredness (the only pain felt was emotional and this was endured by Balthorn).  She slowly opened her eyes and nodded as if to say “thank you”.  Shortly after that, her eyes rolled up and her breathing became fainter and fainter-then suddenly it stopped.
	He took her in his arms and carried her outside of the ruin.  As luck would have it, it was raining outside now.  He gently set her down and began digging a whole with his hands.  Half an hour or so went by and the hole was large enough to place Dagney into-which he did.  He covered her and out of the corner of his eye he saw a single white rose.  She set it there as she was entering the ruin.  She must have known that she may not make it out alive. He took the rose and grasped it in his hand.  He squeezed it as he was squeezing her hand.  A moment passed and his proud posture stooped down.  He leaned over and placed the rose on her grave.  He stood again and was silent as he watched the rain pour down.  If he were shedding any tears the rain was hiding it.  After a few minutes had passed a wagon being pulled by a large horse was passing by and all of a sudden upon seeing him it stopped.  A head popped out of the door of the wagon and asked if he needed a lift.  He gently shook his head back and forth and in a low tone said “I’d prefer to walk”.  The man in the wagon looked confused and said "you are a strange one, what’s your name?  I insist you let me give you a ride in this weather, stranger”.  Balthorn paused for a moment.  He looked down toward where Dagney laid rest, he remembered the heartache and horror he suffered as a child during his parents attack, he felt sickened to proudly claim a name that had seen so much death with, and a name he was planning to share with the woman he buried earlier.  He then recalled the fear in the vampire’s voice inside the ruin as it shouted “grab that blade!”  He liked that, he liked the way the vampire sounded afraid-trembling.  He looked back at the man in the wagon and in a low tone stated “I’m Blade….and I’ll walk.”
	Balthorn’s genius plan was a success.  The few members of the two parties that were able to escape reported to their respectful camps what had taken place.  According to the vampires, the thieves had attacked them and they were unsure if the thieves hired Balthorn as a mercenary to aid them.  To the thieves’ guild, confusion was spread amongst them as the leaders of the raid were dead now and unable to shed any light on the occurrences-they were just unsure of what happened and why it took place.  They knew this however, the vampires were quick to attack them and a black knight with fighting skills unlike anything they’ve seen before made off with their treasure.  The alliance was broken.
 Many days had passed and Balthorn was restructuring his armor outside a small abode he owned.  He was hardening it, adding to it-perfecting it.  He looked up and saw the sun setting, a time most nords try not to tread outside.  If anyone was around they would have sworn they caught a glimpse of a smile cross his face.  It was not a satisfied smile; no, it was a smile that belonged on the face of a man who was destined to change his world.  This is the story of triumph, of a love lost, this is the story of a man who could see clearly now his sole purpose in life, this is the story of… Blade.

A Triple Tragedy: The Tale of the Falmilgaar Family

The Sacrifice (Book 1/3)


&lt;/p&gt;



[pagebreak]
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
&lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/B_letter.png'&gt;althorn and Wayrl  Falmilgaar grew up Nords in Skyrim and part of a healthy, happy family unit along with their sister Heather.  The three were the children of Bergliot and Elise, a priest of Stendarr and his farmer wife.  The five lived in a house located in the south-east area of the Rift, not far from Riften.  They were a very close family and enjoyed one another's company intently.  They confided in each other and worked together through tough times-an ideal family unit.
The thieves guild were at this time establishing their hold on Riften.  The thieves working at night found out pretty quick that they weren't the only night crawlers out and about-they had frequent run-ins with vampires which were never in their favor.  The leader of the thieves guild, Sarlow Hindaar, had a brilliant idea and decided to attempt to strike a deal with the vampires so that the band of thieves would be safe to roam.  A mark would be made for thieves to identify one another and more importantly so that vampires would know that they are to be left alone.  In return, the thieves would aid the vampires in breaking into people's homes and setting up travelers (tricking them) so that the vampires would have easier access to their needed blood supply.  (A night time buffet with regular humans aiding them to get in where they needed most: a town full of people.  Further, without any run-ins with the security.)  The leader was successful in selling this idea and a deal was struck!
One thief in particular Einar Holger, which (as he saw it) was blessed with lycanthrope-a secret he was comfortable sharing only with his fellow thieves. During a full moon night he suffered from a forced metamorphosis and began his rampage.  This was unfortunate for the Falmilgaar family as they were situated outside of Riften in the woods, alone-prime targets for a raging mad werewolf with an urge to feed.  Elise was just finishing up tending her farm and late chores before she readied herself for bed. 
Einar happened to stumble upon the humble cottage and saw an attractive sweet looking meal--which he helped himself to.  Balthorn and Wayrl along with their sister Heather were preparing for bed and their father was cleaning up the kitchen after dinner when they all heard a shrill blood soaked scream from outside their cottage.  Everyone recognized the voice and went running outside just in time to see the werewolf rip Elise's throat out.  The arrogant werewolf smiled at the young family filled with pride as he has just pleased Hiricine with his hunt.  The children screamed in horror as tears rolled down their once innocent faces, their father grabbed a nearby pitchfork and jumped in front of his kids separating them from the menace.  The werewolf struck out and tore a piece of Bergliot's shoulder off.  Bergliot let out a yell and responded with an upward thrust of the pitch fork into the bottom of the beast's jaw. 
The beast howled from a piercing pain and this caused him to be staggered a bit.  A young Wayrl quickly saw an opportunity.  He took a small dagger he had-a silver dagger given to him by his father and he rushed the monster.  The fearful and unsure child stabbed the beast in his left thigh-the monster roared.  The young child quickly withdrew his little dagger and again slammed it down into the belly of the now writhing werewolf.  The monster let out another howl and fell backward.  The child began to withdraw and jam down the dagger into the werewolf which he now was on top of.  He was screaming and crying at the same time-letting all his adrenaline flow freely. 
The young boy's father ended up having to pull the child off the monster which hurt his wounded shoulder.  Balthorn and Heather watched in horror as they saw their brother become a type of beast himself-a beast full of hatred.  The werewolf then dashed away towards Riften's thieves' hide out-the only place he could call home.
The children attended their father's wounds and began preparing the mother's body for burial.  In the meantime, the werewolf now in his human form known as Einar was dying from the wounds left by the silver dagger.  He lay in his chambers as his friends witnessed his final moments.  Barely unable to move, and barely able to speak, he uttered the whereabouts of this family that injured him so badly.  The thieves' guild decided to retaliate.  They planned on seeking the aid of their new allies-the vampires, which of course would be more than happy to oblige.
Days went past and the Falmilgaar family were still grieving over the loss of their beloved Elise.  But that tragedy would only be the beginnings of what would forge their destiny.  A new terror would begin to cover Skyrim, but this terror would haunt the dreams of the undead and the howling beasts of the night. Again in the evening time, the Falmilgaar family would receive another visit-this time even more devastating than the last.  As the clock struck the witching hour-midnight-a flurry of bats could be heard outside their windows.  The children being young and scared went to their father's chambers to seek comfort.  The father pushed them behind him and he ventured outside the house.  The children waited patiently for his report…  Only silence was heard at first, but that silence was torn apart by their father's strong shout beckoning for his boys to come with anything sharp they could find.
A battle ensued, of vampires and a young family fighting for its life-an ultimate deadly encounter.  The vampires were all over the darkness while again Bergliot gave it his all to defend his children.  This time though, he was outmatched.  The two young boys with their sister and their father were able to fend off the attack, but still their victory didn't seem like one.  Bergliot was horrified as he watched a vampire stretch out his hand toward Heather-his beloved little girl and cast destruction magic that engulfed the little girl in flames.  The two brothers lunged at the evil menace.  Wayrl stuck his little dagger into the side of the vampire which bought enough time for Balthorn to drive a wooden steak right through the evil being's heart.  But it was still too late…The little girl was screaming as she became engulfed.  She stood up slowly while her skin turned black and flames began to burst out of her flesh.  The flames danced around her body engulfing every part of her, it scorched her dress and caught her hair ablaze.  The pain she felt and wished would go away only grew stronger.  The prism of pyro continued its dance about the humble cottage.  It continued to spread and consume the house as if it were driven by lust for the abode.  The vampires being shy around fire (one of the few weaknesses they have) began to leave the premises-their work was done, they have indeed tortured this family.
Heather's father offering himself as the ultimate gift of love cast an alteration spell that cast his own life essence outside his body into his little girl's.  His thought was that he would sacrifice himself to save her, which was correct-but not as he had imagined.  The little Heather would be saved but the destruction magic that was burning her was fused to her skin as her father's powerful spell was cast into her in order to heal her.  The very same spell that saved her life would become her life's curse.  A young lady forever inflamed with the memories of her family's horrible attack-a burning inferno.  She ran away from their cottage while screaming in agony while her lifeless father's eyes stared on in her direction-watching her leave, for the last time. It is said that she is to be only seen again when there are innocents that are wrongfully harmed-or so the story goes.
Her two siblings only grew closer since only they knew the pain that has been bestowed upon them.  They began to hunt the various creatures that are responsible for their parent's death and their sister's curse.  They practiced and perfected their bloody craft-too hunt evil.  They cast away their old names, breaking away from the only thing left that connected them to their horrible past.  They took on new names-but theirs is a different tale.  This is the story. . . of Burning Inferno.</Source>

The werewolf then dashed away towards Riften's thieves' hide out-the only place he could call home.
The children attended their father's wounds and began preparing the mother's body for burial.  In the meantime, the werewolf now in his human form known as Einar was dying from the wounds left by the silver dagger.  He lay in his chambers as his friends witnessed his final moments.  Barely unable to move, and barely able to speak, he uttered the whereabouts of this family that injured him so badly.  The thieves' guild decided to retaliate.  They planned on seeking the aid of their new allies-the vampires, which of course would be more than happy to oblige.
Days went past and the Falmilgaar family were still grieving over the loss of their beloved Elise.  But that tragedy would only be the beginnings of what would forge their destiny.  A new terror would begin to cover Skyrim, but this terror would haunt the dreams of the undead and the howling beasts of the night. Again in the evening time, the Falmilgaar family would receive another visit-this time even more devastating than the last.  As the clock struck the witching hour-midnight-a flurry of bats could be heard outside their windows.  The children being young and scared went to their father's chambers to seek comfort.  The father pushed them behind him and he ventured outside the house.  The children waited patiently for his report…  Only silence was heard at first, but that silence was torn apart by their father's strong shout beckoning for his boys to come with anything sharp they could find.
A battle ensued, of vampires and a young family fighting for its life-an ultimate deadly encounter.  The vampires were all over the darkness while again Bergliot gave it his all to defend his children.  This time though, he was outmatched.  The two young boys with their sister and their father were able to fend off the attack, but still their victory didn't seem like one.  Bergliot was horrified as he watched a vampire stretch out his hand toward Heather-his beloved little girl and cast destruction magic that engulfed the little girl in flames.  The two brothers lunged at the evil menace.  Wayrl stuck his little dagger into the side of the vampire which bought enough time for Balthorn to drive a wooden steak right through the evil being's heart.  But it was still too late…The little girl was screaming as she became engulfed.  She stood up slowly while her skin turned black and flames began to burst out of her flesh.  The flames danced around her body engulfing every part of her, it scorched her dress and caught her hair ablaze.  The pain she felt and wished would go away only grew stronger.  The prism of pyro continued its dance about the humble cottage.  It continued to spread and consume the house as if it were driven by lust for the abode.  The vampires being shy around fire (one of the few weaknesses they have) began to leave the premises-their work was done, they have indeed tortured this family.
Heather's father offering himself as the ultimate gift of love cast an alteration spell that cast his own life essence outside his body into his little girl's.  His thought was that he would sacrifice himself to save her, which was correct-but not as he had imagined.  The little Heather would be saved but the destruction magic that was burning her was fused to her skin as her father's powerful spell was cast into her in order to heal her.  The very same spell that saved her life would become her life's curse.  A young lady forever inflamed with the memories of her family's horrible attack-a burning inferno.  She ran away from their cottage while screaming in agony while her lifeless father's eyes stared on in her direction-watching her leave, for the last time. It is said that she is to be only seen again when there are innocents that are wrongfully harmed-or so the story goes.
Her two siblings only grew closer since only they knew the pain that has been bestowed upon them.  They began to hunt the various creatures that are responsible for their parent's death and their sister's curse.  They practiced and perfected their bloody craft-too hunt evil.  They cast away their old names, breaking away from the only thing left that connected them to their horrible past.  They took on new names-but theirs is a different tale.  This is the story. . . of Burning Inferno.</Dest>

A Triple Tragedy: The Tale of the Falmilgaar Family


&lt;/p&gt;



[pagebreak]
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
&lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/W_letter.png'&gt;ayrl had departed ways with his brother Balthorn since he was wanting some extra space-some alone time to clear his head as he put it.  His brother on his 28th birthday desired a companion with which he would share his life with (as most young men around that age will begin thinking about).  Wayrl being the more adventurous type didn't care to settle down but respected his older brother's decision.  They have lived together and hunted for close to ten years now, and trained together daily for the previous ten years before that.  He understood why his brother was tired.  He also knew that no matter how hard his brother fought against it, he was a Falmilgaar hunter.  Eventually he would seek comfort by returning home-which was wherever his brother was. (Reliving the pains of loss they experienced when they were children was very strong and they drew strength from one another when they were down).  And once united again, they would hunt the creatures of the night.
	Wayrl had heard of a camp setting up north near Windhelm which was recruiting for a group known as 'The Companions', a Nordic group that was known for their ferocity-something he thought he would be greatly interested in.  While his brother Balthorn headed west in search of rediscovering himself (whom would eventually happen upon a massacre), he would head north to Windhelm and seek out this camp.  Little did he know just how right he was about his family being destined to hunt down the night dwellers, and little did he know, that he was about to embark on his own adventure. . .
	 The night was cool and a gentle mist could be seen covering the outskirts of the town.  Piercing yellow eyes could be seen staring intently toward the hamlet.  The beast's breath was noticeable as it exhaled.  As it slowly inched forward closer to what it was so focused on, twigs from underneath its feat cracked.  A young girl was playing in the late hours outside with a bunny her father had trapped for her.  She was petting the furry little critter when a looming shadow swallowed her.  She looked up. . . A high pitched scream was heard echoing throughout the small town.  Flustered townsmen rushed outside to see what the source of the terrifying sound was.  A small circle of people gathered around a caged bunny that had been splattered with blood and a torn blood stained dress that belonged to the innocent young girl.  From the back of the crowd, a loud yell of denial was heard and an elderly woman dropped to her knees with her hands covering her face while her husband placed his hand on her shoulder.  The crowd not knowing how to comfort the woman and her husband slowly approached her and offered what little solace they were able to. 
	A very muscular man in his mid-twenties a few days later rode his mighty steed through the quite hamlet of Kynesgrove.  Eyes stared at him taking in his paladin like steel armor which was adorned with a blue hem.  The sun glistened off of it and irritated the watery eyes of the local townsfolk.  He rode proud, much like a paladin would and emitted a confident aura all around.  He came to a halt as his path was suddenly blocked by a rather upset looking older man.  'What is it sir?' the confident Wayrl asked.  'You look like a mercenary for hire or an adventurer needing something to do-either way you can handle business and I have business for you if you are interested', said the aged fellow.  'What is your name and what is your business?' asked Wayrl.  'My name is, Gorenth Agmund and I am looking to hire a hunter.  Our town has become prey recently to a werewolf.  We have suffered many losses.'  Wayrl responded, 'I'm on my way toward Windhelm, but I'll do what I can to aid you.  What can you tell me of the beast?'  'He is rather large and crafty' responded Gorenth, 'it seems he has only recently moved in nearby as the attacks started about three weeks ago.  We were able keep him out a few times, but he is becoming more persistent.  Just a few nights back he attacked Maggie, a little girl of only 7 who was out playing with her pet rabbit.  No one else was out so he took her, all that remained was a terrified rabbit and a piece of her blood stained dress.' Wayrl suffered a horrible flashback of his mother having her throat torn out by the same type of creature.  He closed his eyes and shook his head.  'What else can you tell me?' he asked.  Gorenth reluctantly shrugged his shoulders, 'that's about it.  We are not sure where he is coming from or why he is hunting us.  There is a cave to the east of here, we suspect he may be hiding there but none of us are equipped enough to handle such a threat.'  'Leave it to me.'  Wayrl responded, 'I'll handle it.'  Gorenth looked up to him and smiled.  'We'll pay you well.'  Wayrl didn't even give him a nod upon hearing this; he simply rode forward towards Windhelm.
	The crafty hunter always felt that he had an upper advantage over his enemies.  His head strong attitude never allowed him to fail.  Even when faced with the most dire of circumstances, he never doubted in his own skill, and he always saw himself as being victorious (it's for those very traits that he has been able to survive in such a rugged career path: Hunter).  He assumed he would meet with the Companions and enlist their aid to hunt down the werewolf-that they would help him track it and kill it.  In a way, he was right.  After a few days of travel he reached Windhelm and it didn't take long for him to find the temporary camp setup of the Companions.  He greeted them and they him, and he asked to learn more about them.  In particular, a fellow stood out that had obviously seen his fair share of battles.  'My name is Farkas, brother.  What is it you want to know about us?'  'I have heard you guys are looking to recruit some muscle' said Wayrl.  'Indeed we are' answered Farkas, 'but first we gotta' see if you're as good as you think you are.'  The Companions explained that he would need to beat a challenger of their choosing and then they would consider taking him on board.  Wayrl was eager to show them what he was capable of doing.
	Inside a circle surrounded by bones, an area referred to as 'the pit' that the Companions had made outside of their camp, stood Wayrl and his challenger, a barbarian of a man named Horrith.  The Companions stood outside the pit of bones and citizens of Windhelm also joined the spectacle.  The fight commenced.  Horrith cracked his knuckles inside a tightly clenched fist to signal he was ready, while Wayrl simply bowed his head-never taking his eye off of his opponent (just like he and his brother would start every sparring session).  Horrith let out a barbarian war cry and charged at Wayrl.  Wayrl waited for a moment for the time to execute his first strike.  When the barbarian was close enough, Wayrl crouched low and using the force of a pivot inward toward his opponent was able to successfully strike the beast of a man in the gut with a tight fist.  The air in Horrith's lungs was forced out and he staggered a bit to the side trying to keep distance between himself and Wayrl.  But Wayrl wouldn't have it, being a seasoned fighter, he knew never to let up.  He dashed towards Horrith and kicked him in the back of the knee causing Horrith to lean back.  As Horrith was trying to stand back up straight, his face was met with a downward hammer-fist that finished knocking him back on the flat of his back.  All the spectators gasped in awe at how quickly and precisely the expert fighter was able to execute his technique.  While Horrith was down, Wayrl straddled his right leg and picked up Horrith's right foot.  He twisted his body locking Horrith's leg between his own two legs and applied pressure to the foot downward causing extreme pain for the humbled barbarian.  With enough pressure he could easily snap the leg, but he didn't go that far, he just applied enough to immobilize the large man.
	He looked out toward the crowd and eyed Farkas waiting for him to signal that the fight was over.  Farkas was taken back a bit at how quickly the fight was over and responded as soon as his shocked expression was able to fade away from his face.  'You got yourself a place here friend.'  After hearing this, Wayrl released the trapped leg of his opponent and all could hear a sigh of relief come from Horrith who was in no hurry to stand up.  'Where did you learn to fight like that?' Farkas asked.  'My brother and I created this fighting style.'  He responded.  The Companions were very interested in taking on this young lad as their own and learning from him while offering to teach him what they could as well.  However, Wayrl would not show them everything that he and his brother have developed; they told each other long ago that these secret techniques give them the advantage in any situation and to let them out of their inner circle would prove detrimental.  No, he would only show them a few of the basics-which would impress them enough.  'I will be happy to teach you.' He said, 'but you'll need to assist me with a favor as well.'  'What is that?'  Farkas replied.  'Just south of here, a town known as Kynesgrove has recently fallen victim to a werewolf.  I would like to request the help of your guild to dispatch the beast for them.  A few of your fighters and myself should be able to track and kill it quick enough-you can even keep the payment.'  Farkas, rubbed his chin in contemplation while the other Companions looked on eagerly waiting on how he would respond.  Then he spoke, 'Consider it done.  That isn't the type of job we usually take, but money is money.  Rest with us at camp tonight and tomorrow we'll venture to Kynesgrove and see what we can do.'  Wayrl nodded and did not notice the skeptical looks the rest of the Companions were suddenly wearing.
	While Wayrl rested his head in his private tent, sleeping next to his silver sword (given as a gift the same time Balthorn received his silver sword from their father's friend after the funeral), Farkas was investigating into the werewolf matter that Wayrl spoke of.  Farkas had heard of recent attacks at other towns they camped near as well and he suspected the worse-a companion had begun 'hunting' on his own.  There is a code amongst the Companions that hunts should not harm the innocent, but rather their prey, and only their prey.  Even if a traveler were to happen upon them, they should do their best to avoid the need to kill him (unless of course he were a hunter).  This is why some people who have happened upon a beast of the night was able to live and tell about it-though afraid, they were never in danger.  Farkas had grown suspect of a fellow brother named Bastion but wasn't positive.  He had a problem however, that was as bold as a bright new moon:  If it was in fact a Companion that was murdering nearby villagers, there was a huge chance that the Companion's 'blessing' might be exposed-which would damage the whole guild-this could not be allowed.
	
Farkas being unsure about the identity of the werewolf and suspecting it to be one of his own could not risk killing the beast as Wayrl had wanted to, however in order to appease Wayrl (an exceptional candidate) he would have to come up with a plan.  He met with the other select few Companions that were inside 'the Circle' and came up with a scheme.  He would enter into his werewolf form the next day and would send Wayrl and a couple others to accompany him to Kynesgrove.  That night, while in his beast form, he would make an appearance and scare the hell out of the townsmen, he would make it convenient for Bastion Arithol-his close friend and fellow Companion in the inner circle (as well as suspected murderer) to attack him out in the woods.  He'll howl and Bastion will dip his blade in deer's blood to complete the effect.  Bastion will then emerge before Wayrl or anyone else are able to see the beast make his way back to safety upon the hill behind the woods.  By doing this, Farkas would be able to read Bastion's reactions (as well as see if he acted familiar with the area) and appease Wayrl and help the villagers feel safer.  A good plan it was and all agreed on it.  Also, they would make some quick coin too!  That is always a plus in any situation.
	The next day Wayrl was eager to head out and setup near Kynesgrove.  Farkas told him that he was going to stay at camp and monitor the new recruitments, but he was sending a couple of his best fighters along with Wayrl to aid in dispatching the werewolf.  Farkas figured if Wayrl proved himself over time that he would slowly introduce the topic of lycanthrope and maybe, hopefully after Wayrl grew closer to the guild he would at least be a little interested in receiving the same blessing they enjoyed.  Keeping a fighter as skilled as Wayrl would benefit the guild no doubt and Farkas knew it.  Wayrl nodded and along with Bastion and another Companion set out toward Kynesgrove.
	They quickly setup an operations camp just outside the town and waited for nightfall.  Wayrl tracked down Gorenth and told him the plan.  'Tonight we will rid you of your werewolf menace if we are lucky enough that he show himself.'  Gorenth was over joyed at the sound of that.  The time came, night grew upon them and Wayrl along with the two Companions took their places.  Wayrl would watch the south side of town, while Bastion would watch the east side (which faced some woods as well the mountain hills that Farkas would make his escape into.  Farkas had already set the deer blood in place earlier that day.) And the 2nd Companion, Brendal (who was unaware of the inner circle) kept watch of the north and west sides.  They waited for sun to finish setting and Brendal and Wayrl said silent prayers for the beast to please make an appearance.  They're prayer's would be answered, but not by any deity.
	As was planned Farkas (now as a werewolf) came rushing down the mountain making horrendous growling sounds.  The townsmen ran inside with haste and peeked out their windows to see if the hired mercenaries would in fact be able to dispatch their local demon.  Bastion caught site of the beast, 'damn it!  I see him, he's coming!  I'm going in!'  Wayrl hollered for him to stop so he could aid him, but Bastion had already taken off. Wayrl and Brendal went running after him.  From within the woods, a loud howl could be heard.  The sword was dipped in blood and Farkas made his way up the hill-top to safety with the furious speed of Hircine's curse.  Bastion strolled out in a confident, yet exhausted manner.  Wayrl and Brendal saw him and his sword, which was covered in blood.  They looked at him in disbelief.  Before they could say anything a local saw the three and the blood that was dripping down the silver edge of the sword.  Bastion smiled at the local and raised his sword high in the air for all the locals to be witness of his great dead.  The locals were thrilled and threw a feast for the three in their local inn, Braidwood Inn.  The feast was great and mead was in plenty.  However, during all the celebrating Wayrl had an uneasy gut feeling, everything was too simple.  After the payment was dispersed and celebration came to an end, the inn keeper offered the three a place to stay for free.  A soft bed was a lot better than a hay pile in a tent and all thanked him and headed toward their rooms.  Later however, Wayrl did sneak out and attempt to explore the area that Batsion had come from when he declared victory.  He never found a body, but there was an area covered in blood (Farkas threw the bucket of deer blood out, and splattered an area of foliage to enhance the effect.)  Further, Wayrl noticed Bastion's sword was made out of silver, so if he injured the werewolf that badly, surely the animal crawled somewhere and died… surely.  If only Waryl had stayed a bit longer to observe the area, he would have seen a glorious beast-Farkas-quietly lurking, sniffing, and investigating the area himself.  While in the form of the wolf his senses were so much keener than a mere man's.  He was on to something.  What was it?  A scent-a faint scent, but still recognizable.  That was a problem.  He recognized it.  It was of his close friend Bastion.  Since the smell was faint, that proved Bastion had been in the area before and this scent was not of a man, but of a wolf-a werewolf.  Farkas was truly hurt and even wanted to deny it, but the scent was there.  The evidence was literally overwhelming him.  He would have to remedy this situation somehow.
	Many weeks have past now and Wayrl and Farkas were developing a nice friendship.  Wayrl was enjoying the company of the Companions and completely agreed with their way of life.  He enjoyed being hired as a mercenary and fighting for whatever cause-just so long as he was fighting.  He traveled around with the recruitment camp and stopped near various towns and villages to bring on new blood.  His was very excited that the recruitment venture was almost over and the he would be able to travel to Whiterun with the Companions and join them at their base in Jorrvaskr .  The recruitment party was planning to travel south of Skyrim near Falkreath and head up toward Whiterun from there.  One thing bothered our young hero however, he did hear stories from locals of whatever part he was staying at tell of unusual werewolf attacks (as did Farkas).  Further, he never felt one hundred percent sure about the situation in Kynesgrove.  But he set his feelings aside and continued with the Companions.  The excitement of heading south was showing on Wayrl's face.  He would be closer to home and he was planning on visiting his and his brother's home that they built not very far from their parents' house.  He was sure his brother would be back from his trip and was eager to see him again after all this time.	
	But his excitement was short lived.  The recruitment campaign had been a success and quite a few new young warriors had joined the Companions' guild.  They were on their way to Whiterun and decided to settle down near Riverwood for a week or two.  Growing weary of the same old scenery of camp tents, Wayrl took a trip up into Riverwood and saw again a somber setting.  Townsmen were huddled around a little cross made of wood that had been placed near the river that flows through Riverwood.  He could easily see by the attire that this was a funeral.  He overheard of the loss of a man not much younger than himself who was engaged recently.  His name was Arlan Egil, an elf who asked a lovely young local Imperial, Angelica Oceana to marry him.  He was cleaning his clothes by the stream during night and the beast struck.  Wayrl's heart sank, he's heard about too many attacks that seem to be following this camp…..He began to suspect at least one of his new found friends was holding a dark secret.  A few at the funeral saw the tall and muscular young Wayrl just briefly before he left.  His heart grew angry.  Someone was going to pay.  He began watching the members closer and would ask uncomfortable questions.  He didn't care, he was a very direct individual and when something was off, he was quick to find it.
	A decisive Farkas saw his greatest candidate growing suspicious and had heard the questions he was asking.  Farkas knew that Wayrl was on to his once close friend Bastion.  As much as it hurt him, he knew what had to be done.  Bastion had strayed and gone against the oaths he swore and the honor of the Companions.  He had lost the inner fight all those of the blessing struggle against and his beast side had taken completely over (a risk all the Inner Circle had to face).  He had to be killed.  By killing Bastion and ensuring the safety of the innocent he would be able to redeem his honor since this was his friend (he felt he should have known) and this took place on his watch.  Also, by eliminating the unstable hunter, he would be able to preserve the Companion's name-no one would know or associate the Companion's with the murders that took place.  He would be unable to expose Bastion out publicly as this would lead on to the Companion's deepest secret, also it was best to not be directly involved-in his position it was best to keep his hands clean.  He knew the better plan instead was to somehow tip off Waryl, since he was already suspect of Bastion and one of the few recruits with the fighting skills to take on a werewolf.  He simply left a note in the night in front of Wayrl's tent that read: 'You are correct in your suspicions.  It is Bastion, he's a servant of Hircin, a murderer, and a risk to all of us (which was true, just not as Wayrl understood it).  Watch out for him.'  The letter was signed, 'A friend.'
Wayrl kept an eye on Bastion.  A few days went by when he noticed Bastion leaving the camp-quite late in fact.  Bastion was heading towards Embershard mine-usually a bandit hang-out.  He quietly followed Bastion using the skills he had practiced with his brother during Hide and Seek.  Wayrl was always just a tad bit better at it than his brother-in fact he enjoyed the stealth approach so much that he dabbled in the arcane arts of illusion focusing primarily on invisibility.  He loved to quietly sneak up on his brother and scare him when they weren't playing.  His brother after the initial scare would laugh about it-he enjoyed it too.  Bastion started going into a rage and began ripping off his clothes.  He ran into the mine and an all too familiar sound for Wayrl that he still has nightmares about was heard echoing from within the mine-a werewolf howl.  Shortly after that, the raging beast burst out of the mine and ran towards Riverwood-he was hungry, and he was hunting his next victim.  'Not this time.' Wayrl muttered under his breath.  He followed the beast-preying on the stalker-he followed just outside of Riverwood.  The beast's breath could be heard…..an eerie heaving moments before screams of terror.  Bastion had spotted a young Imperial lady laying flowers at the wooden cross-the burial site of her now deceased fiancé.  She was Angelica.  The beast wasted no time at all in ravaging across the distance between him and her.  She was barely able to scream as he picked her up and ran off with her in the direction of the mine.  Her scream was still strong enough to wake up the locals, but by then it was too late.  By the time the locals stepped outside of their humble homes, her screaming was off in the distance growing fainter.  They weren't even sure where it was coming from.  Wayrl did however, he knew exactly where from.
	With haste equel to that of the beast he was hunting, he followed it back to the mine.  The werewolf had plans to enjoy his midnight snack in this place, but Wayrl had different plans for the cursed creature.  Visions of his mother played over and over again in his mind.  'No, no more.' he said.  
Inside the mine, the creature tossed the lovely and terrified young lady up against the wall, his mouth opened wide letting out a roar as saliva slowly dripped down his jaw.  His arms were spread and his claws were stretched out-he was ready for the kill, but then again, so was Wayrl.  Wayrl jumped toward the large beast and drove his silver sword straight through the back of the monster.  As soon as the shock was over, Bastion turned and back fisted Wayrl.  Still, the sword was sticking out of his belly.  The beast and Wayrl were squared off against one another.  It was an ultimate deadly encounter.  The monster lunged at Wayrl with a snarl and Waryl rolled out of the way.  He found a pick axe lying nearby and swung it heavily into the chest of the werewolf.  Not being silver, it hurt but didn't do severe damage to the monster.  Angelica took no time at all to find an escape and dashed for the exit of the mine.
	After jamming the pickaxe into the chest of Bastion, Wayrl lunged shoulder first in to the werewolf.  As soon as his shoulder hit the werewolf's shoulder he spun behind him keeping close proximity.  Once he was completely behind him, he withdrew his sword.  The beast howled from pain and jumped away.  It extended its claws again and quickly dashed to the right of Wayrl, our hero took a swing, but was unable to deliver as the creature jumped off his landing point and lunged again.  The monster was able to knock the blade from Wayrl's hand.  The beast rammed into Wayrl as he tried to recover his sword, knocking him back against a table.  Wayrl, quickly drew his little silver dagger (the same dagger he used to attack the werewolf that murdered his mother).  Bastion again lunged toward what he thought was a helpless Wayrl.  As Bastion landed near the table he used all his might to tear in to and crush…nothing?  Bastion in a panick looked around.  From out of a corner a dagger came flying at him and jammed itself in his throat (Wayrl had cloaked himself in shadows!)  An almost demonic growl was heard. As the beast took a step back Wayrl tried to kick the dagger deeper in, but Bastion was able to knock it out first.  Still, that is two silver attacks on the werewolf and he was beginning to feel weak.  Wayrl took notice of this and leapt at the opportunity he saw.  He barrel rolled past the side of the monster and jumped on his back.  He squeezed the monster's waste with his legs as tight as he could.  He reached in front of the monster and found the hole that the dagger had made while lodged in his throat.  He grabbed onto opposite sides of the wound and began pulling it to opposite directions with every ounce of strength he had.
	The beast tried to slam him against the wall.  He would jump backwards toward the wall crushing Wayrl who was riding his back.  Wayrl, though in pain remained unfazed.  He continued tearing the wound wider, and wider.  As he began to hear the skin rip, the beast let out an enormous growl which was choked off by grunts of pain.  Wayrl leaned in close to his ear and said 'I will be the bane of your kinds' existence.  This I promise you!'  With that Waryl let out his own monstrous growl which rivaled that of the beast he was riding.  With his last burst of energy he was able to rip open the throat of the beast.  He felt the muscles of Bastion go limp and shortly after that, the monster fell to the ground.  Wayrl was heaving in and out heavily.  He picked up his sword and sat down while leaning back on a wall-he was exhausted.  He closed his eyes and slowly drifted off.  He had dreams of his mother.
	As daylight began showing itself through the windows of the doors to the mine, Wayrl stood.  The mining doors opened and a few of the townsmen had made their way to the mine, but didn't enter for fear of the werewolf.  Out came a tired, but proud Wayrl.  He stood tall with his sword at his side and a fairly large bag draped over his shoulder.  They asked him if he was alright, but he didn't even acknowledge they were there.  He walked into Riverwood carrying the bag and a small gathering began to follow him.  He stepped into the Sleeping Giant Inn.  As he stepped in, he was met with solemn eyes.  A few patrons stood up as if to greet him, but he ignored them.  He walked over to the large table in the center of the Inn which was covered with mead and slammed the bag on the table.  Without a word he opened the bag and out rolled a severed werewolf head.  Nothing but gasps could be heard.  Everyone looked to him.  He spoke, 'this is the end of your werewolf menace.'  The inn keeper spoke up and offered him a reward for killing the monster.  First, she asked him his name.  He stood there for a moment staring at the head on the table.  He had memories of his mother, of his father and his sister.  He felt a burning hatred for his newly found friends-who obviously covered up the events at Kynesgrove and lied to him.  He felt hurt.  It was clear to him what he was becoming.  He was no longer the child that lost his mother, he was no longer the teen that trained with his brother.  He was no longer a man that hunted beast.  He was a beast.  He was a beast full of rage that would haunt him for the rest of his life-a rage he was more than willing to welcome.  He recalled the promise he made to the monster before tearing out its throat.  He looked up toward the inn keeper, 'I am Bane'.  The inn keeper poured what money she had into a coin pouch and offered it to him. He looked around and saw all the faces in awe of him.  He then narrowed his view back on the inn keeper.  He touched her on the shoulder in a friendly manner and said, 'keep your money.  The pleasure I get in killing these things is more than reward enough'.  With that he took his leave.  Once he left, the inn was filled with silence.  Standing in the back there were two hunters adorned with elaborate armor and silver swords.  Their armor had very distinguished claw marks and their belts and arm wrappings boasted of werewolf teeth-Silver Hands. They simply looked at each other, smiled and nodded.
	Farkas got word of this.  He was relieved that the pressure he was faced with was finally gone-the deed had been done, the burden had been removed.  However, he was grieved by the loss of his friend, and in regards to Wayrl, he felt a strong feeling of uneasiness.  He knew Wayrl would be on to the fact that a trick had been played on him and the villagers of Kynesgrove.  That would hurt.  That would lead to feelings of Betrayal, and those feelings could be the seeds that would give birth to a deep hatred-something not to be taken lightly.  Farkas sat alone as he pondered about what type of holy savage he possibly had a hand in making.  
As he was looking forward to earlier, Wayrl headed east-toward home.  It didn't take long for him to reach his destination.  He was happy to rest his weary head on his pillow finally.  For the first time in a couple months he slept well.  Within a few days his brother Balthorn appeared off in the distance.  He was dressed in his black armor and sporting a new ebony blade strapped to his back.  The sword had runic text inscribed on it that glowed in the early hours of the morning.  Wayrl looked toward the sky and witnessed a lovely sunrise.  He loved the daytime.  He was thankful that he was a creature of light that could live amongst the living without dark secrets.  He burned with a hatred of the Companions, he burned with a hatred for the hairy beast that prey on humans.  He smiled at his brother, as he approached closer.  He was willing to accept his change-a fact that he just realized.  He finally understood.  He and his brother weren't really human after all.  But from their life, early on they slowly changed.  They were in a way, monsters themselves-monsters that would instill a new kind of terror across Skyrim; terror that the horrors of the night would feel at last.  This is the story of a burning hate, this is the story of a betrayal that gave birth to a new breed of hunter, this is the story. . . of Bane.
A note from the author:
	This completes the trilogy.  Many stories can be found throughout Skyrim in many a tavern of these three.  I have taken it upon myself in my free time to separate the fact from the fiction and find the truths of the Falmilgaar family and the tragedies that they have endured.  After many interviews and much research, I believe I have now an accurate record of the events that took place.  I wish to remain unknown as I am of no significant importance.  But I will say this: during these dark times in Skyrim when travelers need beware the many horrible random encounters that can occur, I am fortunate enough to have lived in the time of these special three people-the protectors that have gone through so much, give so much, and ask for nothing in return.  Eventually the sands of time will run its course and their story will have faded away.  This is why I have written their story here.  I hope that somehow, they will find it, and they will find solace in that their story has been told.  They deserve at least that

A Triple Tragedy: The Tale of the Falmilgaar Family


&lt;/p&gt;



[pagebreak]
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
&lt;img src='img://Textures/Interface/Books/Illuminated_Letters/W_letter.png'&gt;ayrl had departed ways with his brother Balthorn since he was wanting some extra space-some alone time to clear his head as he put it.  His brother on his 28th birthday desired a companion with which he would share his life with (as most young men around that age will begin thinking about).  Wayrl being the more adventurous type didn't care to settle down but respected his older brother's decision.  They have lived together and hunted for close to ten years now, and trained together daily for the previous ten years before that.  He understood why his brother was tired.  He also knew that no matter how hard his brother fought against it, he was a Falmilgaar hunter.  Eventually he would seek comfort by returning home-which was wherever his brother was. (Reliving the pains of loss they experienced when they were children was very strong and they drew strength from one another when they were down).  And once united again, they would hunt the creatures of the night.
	Wayrl had heard of a camp setting up north near Windhelm which was recruiting for a group known as 'The Companions', a Nordic group that was known for their ferocity-something he thought he would be greatly interested in.  While his brother Balthorn headed west in search of rediscovering himself (whom would eventually happen upon a massacre), he would head north to Windhelm and seek out this camp.  Little did he know just how right he was about his family being destined to hunt down the night dwellers, and little did he know, that he was about to embark on his own adventure. . .
	 The night was cool and a gentle mist could be seen covering the outskirts of the town.  Piercing yellow eyes could be seen staring intently toward the hamlet.  The beast's breath was noticeable as it exhaled.  As it slowly inched forward closer to what it was so focused on, twigs from underneath its feat cracked.  A young girl was playing in the late hours outside with a bunny her father had trapped for her.  She was petting the furry little critter when a looming shadow swallowed her.  She looked up. . . A high pitched scream was heard echoing throughout the small town.  Flustered townsmen rushed outside to see what the source of the terrifying sound was.  A small circle of people gathered around a caged bunny that had been splattered with blood and a torn blood stained dress that belonged to the innocent young girl.  From the back of the crowd, a loud yell of denial was heard and an elderly woman dropped to her knees with her hands covering her face while her husband placed his hand on her shoulder.  The crowd not knowing how to comfort the woman and her husband slowly approached her and offered what little solace they were able to. 
	A very muscular man in his mid-twenties a few days later rode his mighty steed through the quite hamlet of Kynesgrove.  Eyes stared at him taking in his paladin like steel armor which was adorned with a blue hem.  The sun glistened off of it and irritated the watery eyes of the local townsfolk.  He rode proud, much like a paladin would and emitted a confident aura all around.  He came to a halt as his path was suddenly blocked by a rather upset looking older man.  'What is it sir?' the confident Wayrl asked.  'You look like a mercenary for hire or an adventurer needing something to do-either way you can handle business and I have business for you if you are interested', said the aged fellow.  'What is your name and what is your business?' asked Wayrl.  'My name is, Gorenth Agmund and I am looking to hire a hunter.  Our town has become prey recently to a werewolf.  We have suffered many losses.'  Wayrl responded, 'I'm on my way toward Windhelm, but I'll do what I can to aid you.  What can you tell me of the beast?'  'He is rather large and crafty' responded Gorenth, 'it seems he has only recently moved in nearby as the attacks started about three weeks ago.  We were able keep him out a few times, but he is becoming more persistent.  Just a few nights back he attacked Maggie, a little girl of only 7 who was out playing with her pet rabbit.  No one else was out so he took her, all that remained was a terrified rabbit and a piece of her blood stained dress.' Wayrl suffered a horrible flashback of his mother having her throat torn out by the same type of creature.  He closed his eyes and shook his head.  'What else can you tell me?' he asked.  Gorenth reluctantly shrugged his shoulders, 'that's about it.  We are not sure where he is coming from or why he is hunting us.  There is a cave to the east of here, we suspect he may be hiding there but none of us are equipped enough to handle such a threat.'  'Leave it to me.'  Wayrl responded, 'I'll handle it.'  Gorenth looked up to him and smiled.  'We'll pay you well.'  Wayrl didn't even give him a nod upon hearing this; he simply rode forward towards Windhelm.
	The crafty hunter always felt that he had an upper advantage over his enemies.  His head strong attitude never allowed him to fail.  Even when faced with the most dire of circumstances, he never doubted in his own skill, and he always saw himself as being victorious (it's for those very traits that he has been able to survive in such a rugged career path: Hunter).  He assumed he would meet with the Companions and enlist their aid to hunt down the werewolf-that they would help him track it and kill it.  In a way, he was right.  After a few days of travel he reached Windhelm and it didn't take long for him to find the temporary camp setup of the Companions.  He greeted them and they him, and he asked to learn more about them.  In particular, a fellow stood out that had obviously seen his fair share of battles.  'My name is Farkas, brother.  What is it you want to know about us?'  'I have heard you guys are looking to recruit some muscle' said Wayrl.  'Indeed we are' answered Farkas, 'but first we gotta' see if you're as good as you think you are.'  The Companions explained that he would need to beat a challenger of their choosing and then they would consider taking him on board.  Wayrl was eager to show them what he was capable of doing.
	Inside a circle surrounded by bones, an area referred to as 'the pit' that the Companions had made outside of their camp, stood Wayrl and his challenger, a barbarian of a man named Horrith.  The Companions stood outside the pit of bones and citizens of Windhelm also joined the spectacle.  The fight commenced.  Horrith cracked his knuckles inside a tightly clenched fist to signal he was ready, while Wayrl simply bowed his head-never taking his eye off of his opponent (just like he and his brother would start every sparring session).  Horrith let out a barbarian war cry and charged at Wayrl.  Wayrl waited for a moment for the time to execute his first strike.  When the barbarian was close enough, Wayrl crouched low and using the force of a pivot inward toward his opponent was able to successfully strike the beast of a man in the gut with a tight fist.  The air in Horrith's lungs was forced out and he staggered a bit to the side trying to keep distance between himself and Wayrl.  But Wayrl wouldn't have it, being a seasoned fighter, he knew never to let up.  He dashed towards Horrith and kicked him in the back of the knee causing Horrith to lean back.  As Horrith was trying to stand back up straight, his face was met with a downward hammer-fist that finished knocking him back on the flat of his back.  All the spectators gasped in awe at how quickly and precisely the expert fighter was able to execute his technique.  While Horrith was down, Wayrl straddled his right leg and picked up Horrith's right foot.  He twisted his body locking Horrith's leg between his own two legs and applied pressure to the foot downward causing extreme pain for the humbled barbarian.  With enough pressure he could easily snap the leg, but he didn't go that far, he just applied enough to immobilize the large man.
	He looked out toward the crowd and eyed Farkas waiting for him to signal that the fight was over.  Farkas was taken back a bit at how quickly the fight was over and responded as soon as his shocked expression was able to fade away from his face.  'You got yourself a place here friend.'  After hearing this, Wayrl released the trapped leg of his opponent and all could hear a sigh of relief come from Horrith who was in no hurry to stand up.  'Where did you learn to fight like that?' Farkas asked.  'My brother and I created this fighting style.'  He responded.  The Companions were very interested in taking on this young lad as their own and learning from him while offering to teach him what they could as well.  However, Wayrl would not show them everything that he and his brother have developed; they told each other long ago that these secret techniques give them the advantage in any situation and to let them out of their inner circle would prove detrimental.  No, he would only show them a few of the basics-which would impress them enough.  'I will be happy to teach you.' He said, 'but you'll need to assist me with a favor as well.'  'What is that?'  Farkas replied.  'Just south of here, a town known as Kynesgrove has recently fallen victim to a werewolf.  I would like to request the help of your guild to dispatch the beast for them.  A few of your fighters and myself should be able to track and kill it quick enough-you can even keep the payment.'  Farkas, rubbed his chin in contemplation while the other Companions looked on eagerly waiting on how he would respond.  Then he spoke, 'Consider it done.  That isn't the type of job we usually take, but money is money.  Rest with us at camp tonight and tomorrow we'll venture to Kynesgrove and see what we can do.'  Wayrl nodded and did not notice the skeptical looks the rest of the Companions were suddenly wearing.
	While Wayrl rested his head in his private tent, sleeping next to his silver sword (given as a gift the same time Balthorn received his silver sword from their father's friend after the funeral), Farkas was investigating into the werewolf matter that Wayrl spoke of.  Farkas had heard of recent attacks at other towns they camped near as well and he suspected the worse-a companion had begun 'hunting' on his own.  There is a code amongst the Companions that hunts should not harm the innocent, but rather their prey, and only their prey.  Even if a traveler were to happen upon them, they should do their best to avoid the need to kill him (unless of course he were a hunter).  This is why some people who have happened upon a beast of the night was able to live and tell about it-though afraid, they were never in danger.  Farkas had grown suspect of a fellow brother named Bastion but wasn't positive.  He had a problem however, that was as bold as a bright new moon:  If it was in fact a Companion that was murdering nearby villagers, there was a huge chance that the Companion's 'blessing' might be exposed-which would damage the whole guild-this could not be allowed.
	
Farkas being unsure about the identity of the werewolf and suspecting it to be one of his own could not risk killing the beast as Wayrl had wanted to, however in order to appease Wayrl (an exceptional candidate) he would have to come up with a plan.  He met with the other select few Companions that were inside 'the Circle' and came up with a scheme.  He would enter into his werewolf form the next day and would send Wayrl and a couple others to accompany him to Kynesgrove.  That night, while in his beast form, he would make an appearance and scare the hell out of the townsmen, he would make it convenient for Bastion Arithol-his close friend and fellow Companion in the inner circle (as well as suspected murderer) to attack him out in the woods.  He'll howl and Bastion will dip his blade in deer's blood to complete the effect.  Bastion will then emerge before Wayrl or anyone else are able to see the beast make his way back to safety upon the hill behind the woods.  By doing this, Farkas would be able to read Bastion's reactions (as well as see if he acted familiar with the area) and appease Wayrl and help the villagers feel safer.  A good plan it was and all agreed on it.  Also, they would make some quick coin too!  That is always a plus in any situation.
	The next day Wayrl was eager to head out and setup near Kynesgrove.  Farkas told him that he was going to stay at camp and monitor the new recruitments, but he was sending a couple of his best fighters along with Wayrl to aid in dispatching the werewolf.  Farkas figured if Wayrl proved himself over time that he would slowly introduce the topic of lycanthrope and maybe, hopefully after Wayrl grew closer to the guild he would at least be a little interested in receiving the same blessing they enjoyed.  Keeping a fighter as skilled as Wayrl would benefit the guild no doubt and Farkas knew it.  Wayrl nodded and along with Bastion and another Companion set out toward Kynesgrove.
	They quickly setup an operations camp just outside the town and waited for nightfall.  Wayrl tracked down Gorenth and told him the plan.  'Tonight we will rid you of your werewolf menace if we are lucky enough that he show himself.'  Gorenth was over joyed at the sound of that.  The time came, night grew upon them and Wayrl along with the two Companions took their places.  Wayrl would watch the south side of town, while Bastion would watch the east side (which faced some woods as well the mountain hills that Farkas would make his escape into.  Farkas had already set the deer blood in place earlier that day.) And the 2nd Companion, Brendal (who was unaware of the inner circle) kept watch of the north and west sides.  They waited for sun to finish setting and Brendal and Wayrl said silent prayers for the beast to please make an appearance.  They're prayer's would be answered, but not by any deity.
	As was planned Farkas (now as a werewolf) came rushing down the mountain making horrendous growling sounds.  The townsmen ran inside with haste and peeked out their windows to see if the hired mercenaries would in fact be able to dispatch their local demon.  Bastion caught site of the beast, 'damn it!  I see him, he's coming!  I'm going in!'  Wayrl hollered for him to stop so he could aid him, but Bastion had already taken off. Wayrl and Brendal went running after him.  From within the woods, a loud howl could be heard.  The sword was dipped in blood and Farkas made his way up the hill-top to safety with the furious speed of Hircine's curse.  Bastion strolled out in a confident, yet exhausted manner.  Wayrl and Brendal saw him and his sword, which was covered in blood.  They looked at him in disbelief.  Before they could say anything a local saw the three and the blood that was dripping down the silver edge of the sword.  Bastion smiled at the local and raised his sword high in the air for all the locals to be witness of his great dead.  The locals were thrilled and threw a feast for the three in their local inn, Braidwood Inn.  The feast was great and mead was in plenty.  However, during all the celebrating Wayrl had an uneasy gut feeling, everything was too simple.  After the payment was dispersed and celebration came to an end, the inn keeper offered the three a place to stay for free.  A soft bed was a lot better than a hay pile in a tent and all thanked him and headed toward their rooms.  Later however, Wayrl did sneak out and attempt to explore the area that Batsion had come from when he declared victory.  He never found a body, but there was an area covered in blood (Farkas threw the bucket of deer blood out, and splattered an area of foliage to enhance the effect.)  Further, Wayrl noticed Bastion's sword was made out of silver, so if he injured the werewolf that badly, surely the animal crawled somewhere and died… surely.  If only Waryl had stayed a bit longer to observe the area, he would have seen a glorious beast-Farkas-quietly lurking, sniffing, and investigating the area himself.  While in the form of the wolf his senses were so much keener than a mere man's.  He was on to something.  What was it?  A scent-a faint scent, but still recognizable.  That was a problem.  He recognized it.  It was of his close friend Bastion.  Since the smell was faint, that proved Bastion had been in the area before and this scent was not of a man, but of a wolf-a werewolf.  Farkas was truly hurt and even wanted to deny it, but the scent was there.  The evidence was literally overwhelming him.  He would have to remedy this situation somehow.
	Many weeks have past now and Wayrl and Farkas were developing a nice friendship.  Wayrl was enjoying the company of the Companions and completely agreed with their way of life.  He enjoyed being hired as a mercenary and fighting for whatever cause-just so long as he was fighting.  He traveled around with the recruitment camp and stopped near various towns and villages to bring on new blood.  His was very excited that the recruitment venture was almost over and the he would be able to travel to Whiterun with the Companions and join them at their base in Jorrvaskr .  The recruitment party was planning to travel south of Skyrim near Falkreath and head up toward Whiterun from there.  One thing bothered our young hero however, he did hear stories from locals of whatever part he was staying at tell of unusual werewolf attacks (as did Farkas).  Further, he never felt one hundred percent sure about the situation in Kynesgrove.  But he set his feelings aside and continued with the Companions.  The excitement of heading south was showing on Wayrl's face.  He would be closer to home and he was planning on visiting his and his brother's home that they built not very far from their parents' house.  He was sure his brother would be back from his trip and was eager to see him again after all this time.	
	But his excitement was short lived.  The recruitment campaign had been a success and quite a few new young warriors had joined the Companions' guild.  They were on their way to Whiterun and decided to settle down near Riverwood for a week or two.  Growing weary of the same old scenery of camp tents, Wayrl took a trip up into Riverwood and saw again a somber setting.  Townsmen were huddled around a little cross made of wood that had been placed near the river that flows through Riverwood.  He could easily see by the attire that this was a funeral.  He overheard of the loss of a man not much younger than himself who was engaged recently.  His name was Arlan Egil, an elf who asked a lovely young local Imperial, Angelica Oceana to marry him.  He was cleaning his clothes by the stream during night and the beast struck.  Wayrl's heart sank, he's heard about too many attacks that seem to be following this camp…..He began to suspect at least one of his new found friends was holding a dark secret.  A few at the funeral saw the tall and muscular young Wayrl just briefly before he left.  His heart grew angry.  Someone was going to pay.  He began watching the members closer and would ask uncomfortable questions.  He didn't care, he was a very direct individual and when something was off, he was quick to find it.
	A decisive Farkas saw his greatest candidate growing suspicious and had heard the questions he was asking.  Farkas knew that Wayrl was on to his once close friend Bastion.  As much as it hurt him, he knew what had to be done.  Bastion had strayed and gone against the oaths he swore and the honor of the Companions.  He had lost the inner fight all those of the blessing struggle against and his beast side had taken completely over (a risk all the Inner Circle had to face).  He had to be killed.  By killing Bastion and ensuring the safety of the innocent he would be able to redeem his honor since this was his friend (he felt he should have known) and this took place on his watch.  Also, by eliminating the unstable hunter, he would be able to preserve the Companion's name-no one would know or associate the Companion's with the murders that took place.  He would be unable to expose Bastion out publicly as this would lead on to the Companion's deepest secret, also it was best to not be directly involved-in his position it was best to keep his hands clean.  He knew the better plan instead was to somehow tip off Waryl, since he was already suspect of Bastion and one of the few recruits with the fighting skills to take on a werewolf.  He simply left a note in the night in front of Wayrl's tent that read: 'You are correct in your suspicions.  It is Bastion, he's a servant of Hircin, a murderer, and a risk to all of us (which was true, just not as Wayrl understood it).  Watch out for him.'  The letter was signed, 'A friend.'
Wayrl kept an eye on Bastion.  A few days went by when he noticed Bastion leaving the camp-quite late in fact.  Bastion was heading towards Embershard mine-usually a bandit hang-out.  He quietly followed Bastion using the skills he had practiced with his brother during Hide and Seek.  Wayrl was always just a tad bit better at it than his brother-in fact he enjoyed the stealth approach so much that he dabbled in the arcane arts of illusion focusing primarily on invisibility.  He loved to quietly sneak up on his brother and scare him when they weren't playing.  His brother after the initial scare would laugh about it-he enjoyed it too.  Bastion started going into a rage and began ripping off his clothes.  He ran into the mine and an all too familiar sound for Wayrl that he still has nightmares about was heard echoing from within the mine-a werewolf howl.  Shortly after that, the raging beast burst out of the mine and ran towards Riverwood-he was hungry, and he was hunting his next victim.  'Not this time.' Wayrl muttered under his breath.  He followed the beast-preying on the stalker-he followed just outside of Riverwood.  The beast's breath could be heard…..an eerie heaving moments before screams of terror.  Bastion had spotted a young Imperial lady laying flowers at the wooden cross-the burial site of her now deceased fiancé.  She was Angelica.  The beast wasted no time at all in ravaging across the distance between him and her.  She was barely able to scream as he picked her up and ran off with her in the direction of the mine.  Her scream was still strong enough to wake up the locals, but by then it was too late.  By the time the locals stepped outside of their humble homes, her screaming was off in the distance growing fainter.  They weren't even sure where it was coming from.  Wayrl did however, he knew exactly where from.
	With haste equel to that of the beast he was hunting, he followed it back to the mine.  The werewolf had plans to enjoy his midnight snack in this place, but Wayrl had different plans for the cursed creature.  Visions of his mother played over and over again in his mind.  'No, no more.' he said.  
Inside the mine, the creature tossed the lovely and terrified young lady up against the wall, his mouth opened wide letting out a roar as saliva slowly dripped down his jaw.  His arms were spread and his claws were stretched out-he was ready for the kill, but then again, so was Wayrl.  Wayrl jumped toward the large beast and drove his silver sword straight through the back of the monster.  As soon as the shock was over, Bastion turned and back fisted Wayrl.  Still, the sword was sticking out of his belly.  The beast and Wayrl were squared off against one another.  It was an ultimate deadly encounter.  The monster lunged at Wayrl with a snarl and Waryl rolled out of the way.  He found a pick axe lying nearby and swung it heavily into the chest of the werewolf.  Not being silver, it hurt but didn't do severe damage to the monster.  Angelica took no time at all to find an escape and dashed for the exit of the mine.
	After jamming the pickaxe into the chest of Bastion, Wayrl lunged shoulder first in to the werewolf.  As soon as his shoulder hit the werewolf's shoulder he spun behind him keeping close proximity.  Once he was completely behind him, he withdrew his sword.  The beast howled from pain and jumped away.  It extended its claws again and quickly dashed to the right of Wayrl, our hero took a swing, but was unable to deliver as the creature jumped off his landing point and lunged again.  The monster was able to knock the blade from Wayrl's hand.  The beast rammed into Wayrl as he tried to recover his sword, knocking him back against a table.  Wayrl, quickly drew his little silver dagger (the same dagger he used to attack the werewolf that murdered his mother).  Bastion again lunged toward what he thought was a helpless Wayrl.  As Bastion landed near the table he used all his might to tear in to and crush…nothing?  Bastion in a panick looked around.  From out of a corner a dagger came flying at him and jammed itself in his throat (Wayrl had cloaked himself in shadows!)  An almost demonic growl was heard. As the beast took a step back Wayrl tried to kick the dagger deeper in, but Bastion was able to knock it out first.  Still, that is two silver attacks on the werewolf and he was beginning to feel weak.  Wayrl took notice of this and leapt at the opportunity he saw.  He barrel rolled past the side of the monster and jumped on his back.  He squeezed the monster's waste with his legs as tight as he could.  He reached in front of the monster and found the hole that the dagger had made while lodged in his throat.  He grabbed onto opposite sides of the wound and began pulling it to opposite directions with every ounce of strength he had.
	The beast tried to slam him against the wall.  He would jump backwards toward the wall crushing Wayrl who was riding his back.  Wayrl, though in pain remained unfazed.  He continued tearing the wound wider, and wider.  As he began to hear the skin rip, the beast let out an enormous growl which was choked off by grunts of pain.  Wayrl leaned in close to his ear and said 'I will be the bane of your kinds' existence.  This I promise you!'  With that Waryl let out his own monstrous growl which rivaled that of the beast he was riding.  With his last burst of energy he was able to rip open the throat of the beast.  He felt the muscles of Bastion go limp and shortly after that, the monster fell to the ground.  Wayrl was heaving in and out heavily.  He picked up his sword and sat down while leaning back on a wall-he was exhausted.  He closed his eyes and slowly drifted off.  He had dreams of his mother.
	As daylight began showing itself through the windows of the doors to the mine, Wayrl stood.  The mining doors opened and a few of the townsmen had made their way to the mine, but didn't enter for fear of the werewolf.  Out came a tired, but proud Wayrl.  He stood tall with his sword at his side and a fairly large bag draped over his shoulder.  They asked him if he was alright, but he didn't even acknowledge they were there.  He walked into Riverwood carrying the bag and a small gathering began to follow him.  He stepped into the Sleeping Giant Inn.  As he stepped in, he was met with solemn eyes.  A few patrons stood up as if to greet him, but he ignored them.  He walked over to the large table in the center of the Inn which was covered with mead and slammed the bag on the table.  Without a word he opened the bag and out rolled a severed werewolf head.  Nothing but gasps could be heard.  Everyone looked to him.  He spoke, 'this is the end of your werewolf menace.'  The inn keeper spoke up and offered him a reward for killing the monster.  First, she asked him his name.  He stood there for a moment staring at the head on the table.  He had memories of his mother, of his father and his sister.  He felt a burning hatred for his newly found friends-who obviously covered up the events at Kynesgrove and lied to him.  He felt hurt.  It was clear to him what he was becoming.  He was no longer the child that lost his mother, he was no longer the teen that trained with his brother.  He was no longer a man that hunted beast.  He was a beast.  He was a beast full of rage that would haunt him for the rest of his life-a rage he was more than willing to welcome.  He recalled the promise he made to the monster before tearing out its throat.  He looked up toward the inn keeper, 'I am Bane'.  The inn keeper poured what money she had into a coin pouch and offered it to him. He looked around and saw all the faces in awe of him.  He then narrowed his view back on the inn keeper.  He touched her on the shoulder in a friendly manner and said, 'keep your money.  The pleasure I get in killing these things is more than reward enough'.  With that he took his leave.  Once he left, the inn was filled with silence.  Standing in the back there were two hunters adorned with elaborate armor and silver swords.  Their armor had very distinguished claw marks and their belts and arm wrappings boasted of werewolf teeth-Silver Hands. They simply looked at each other, smiled and nodded.
	Farkas got word of this.  He was relieved that the pressure he was faced with was finally gone-the deed had been done, the burden had been removed.  However, he was grieved by the loss of his friend, and in regards to Wayrl, he felt a strong feeling of uneasiness.  He knew Wayrl would be on to the fact that a trick had been played on him and the villagers of Kynesgrove.  That would hurt.  That would lead to feelings of Betrayal, and those feelings could be the seeds that would give birth to a deep hatred-something not to be taken lightly.  Farkas sat alone as he pondered about what type of holy savage he possibly had a hand in making.  
As he was looking forward to earlier, Wayrl headed east-toward home.  It didn't take long for him to reach his destination.  He was happy to rest his weary head on his pillow finally.  For the first time in a couple months he slept well.  Within a few days his brother Balthorn appeared off in the distance.  He was dressed in his black armor and sporting a new ebony blade strapped to his back.  The sword had runic text inscribed on it that glowed in the early hours of the morning.  Wayrl looked toward the sky and witnessed a lovely sunrise.  He loved the daytime.  He was thankful that he was a creature of light that could live amongst the living without dark secrets.  He burned with a hatred of the Companions, he burned with a hatred for the hairy beast that prey on humans.  He smiled at his brother, as he approached closer.  He was willing to accept his change-a fact that he just realized.  He finally understood.  He and his brother weren't really human after all.  But from their life, early on they slowly changed.  They were in a way, monsters themselves-monsters that would instill a new kind of terror across Skyrim; terror that the horrors of the night would feel at last.  This is the story of a burning hate, this is the story of a betrayal that gave birth to a new breed of hunter, this is the story. . . of Bane.
A note from the author:
	This completes the trilogy.  Many stories can be found throughout Skyrim in many a tavern of these three.  I have taken it upon myself in my free time to separate the fact from the fiction and find the truths of the Falmilgaar family and the tragedies that they have endured.  After many interviews and much research, I believe I have now an accurate record of the events that took place.  I wish to remain unknown as I am of no significant importance.  But I will say this: during these dark times in Skyrim when travelers need beware the many horrible random encounters that can occur, I am fortunate enough to have lived in the time of these special three people-the protectors that have gone through so much, give so much, and ask for nothing in return.  Eventually the sands of time will run its course and their story will have faded away.  This is why I have written their story here.  I hope that somehow, they will find it, and they will find solace in that their story has been told.  They deserve at least that

[pagebreak]

&lt;p align="left"&gt;

	You like that? I wrote it sitting by a campfire one night when my father and I were running the back trail of the Rumiirua. I used to dream I'd be a famous bard one day. I dreamt that my father would be proud. Now he's dead and there's no one left to care what I do.

	I decided to call this The Legacy of the Rumiirua to keep it consistent with Jebidiah's journal, even though I prefer The Lord of the Dead. Jebidiah Halfwitch, curse that stupid bastard. If he had just hidden in his cellar like his wife wanted they would all still be alive. More to the point, he wouldn't have written his stupid journal and my family might also be alive. My father at least, is what I mean. My mother and sister were already gone when my father found Jebidiah's book.

	I imagine all kinds of people have written accounts of what happened that first night and every night since. Every day as well, for that matter. Everyone wants to leave behind some kind of legacy. 

	In that respect, Jebidiah's journal was no different than dozens, maybe hundreds of other stories. Except Jebidiah's was the the one my father found. Well, that and the fact that Jebidiah had stumbled across a small bit of the truth of where these monsters came from. 

	My father was a good man by the name of Sebastian Cain. He was a farmer like Jebidiah. And like Jebidiah, had lost all his family except me. He probably felt some sort of kinship to him. Some sympathy or pity. Or maybe just the need to succeed where Jebidiah had failed. In any case, Jebidiah's book set him on a path. 

	But I guess that comes a bit later. I should start with the night when the dead rose, like Jebidiah did. Except I'll try to stay much more on point. Lord, could that man ramble on.

	My name is Deckard, youngest of two brothers. 14 years old the day the dead came back. I had gone with my father into town for supplies that day. Feed, and a bit of lumber for rebuilding fences. We had a farm not far from Windhelm and were traveling back home on horseback pulling our cart around supper time when we saw the first of the dead. It was slowly stumbling along the side of the road by itself when we passed. We thought he was drunk. He moved to swipe at our horse, but was too far away and too slow. He simply lurched towards it and fell over. It was only later that we realized with horror what he must have been. At the time we just laughed at the stupid drunk. My father made some comment about pulling him off the road, but as we looked back he was already getting up.

	We traveled on and forgot about it. About and hour later we began to pass a few homes and farms. The first few were totally silent, which didn't even occur to me then but later I realized we should have heard cows, chickens, horses, something. Then our horses began to spook. Nothing alarming, but you could tell they caught wind of something they didn't like. 

	We came upon a homestead where, as we approached we could hear screaming and crying. My father and I exchanged a nervous glance. He stopped the horses and told me to wait with them while he went to see if he could help with something. I watched him walk to the front door and knock. Then, when there was no answer, he walked around the side of the house and out of my sight.

	I sat and waited, concerned but not scared, as the horses fidgeted nervously . I don't know how long. Then my father came sprinting around the house in a mad panic. As a child, there are few things more terrifying than seeing a parent terrified. My father came sprinting around the corner so fast he lost his footing and almost fell. He caught himself one-handed and kept right on running. When he reached the horses, he jumped on and spurred the horses hard. We took off with a jolt as I asked my father repeatedly what had happened. He wouldn't answer, except to say we needed to get help. 

	We rode like that for a while in silence. Then we began to pass other homes and farms. We heard cries from some of them and saw two men struggling in a field off in the distance. This went on for a few miles. Eventually my father looked at me with panic in his eyes. I asked again what was happening. He stopped the horses, jumped down and unhitched them from the cart. He climbed back on and told me to keep up. He said we were going to ride as fast as we could because we had to get home now.

	We rode for what seemed like an eternity, but it was probably less than an hour. Along the way I began to understand that whatever was happening, it was happening everywhere. And that my mother and older brother were almost certainly in danger. It never occurred to me that we would not make it home in time.

	When we arrived my father once again told me to wait with the horses, which I did briefly. But when I heard his anguished cry from inside I ran as hard as I could. As I reached for the door, what I saw literally took the wind from me. My father was on his knees, kneeling in a pool of blood, holding what was left of my mother to his chest. Her stomach was just a great empty hole with nothing in it. I could actually see her spine. 

	This was the womb where I had grown. Now a gaping hole with gore and scraps of flesh hanging out. That didn't occur to me till later. At the moment I was just in shock and not capable of coherent thought. The rest of her seemed to be missing small pieces here and there. Bites, they looked like. My brother lay near by. He looked even worse. The sounds coming from my father were more horrifying than anything I had ever heard before. I've heard worse since, but not that night.

	Months later, as I write this, looking back, it's all still crystal clear. The sight, every scrap of flesh. The blood everywhere. The smell, rotten meat and shit. But mostly the sounds. My father wailed and wept and drooled. Eventually he went into some kind of daze. Not quite passed out but close. 

	I managed to pull him outside some time later. I was still numb, but I understood that he was in worse shape than me at that time. I had to take care of him. We slept up in the loft of our barn that night.

	We burned them. This was some time the next day. My father came back around the next morning. Around sunrise. He was himself again. We burned the bodies in silence. Neither one of us knew any prayers. What would the point have been anyhow? 

	My mother's name was Myriam. My brother was Jonas. There's nothing left of them now except their names recorded here. There's really nothing left of anything now. 

	That was how it began. My father found new strength after that and set out to kill as many of those things as he could. Back then we still didn't really understand what they were of course. But we traveled and we killed. Oh yes, we. My father taught me well. Skinny fourteen-year-old with a sword and mace. My books put away and the farm forgotten. 

	My father apparently had some previous combat experience he never discussed. Because he led us to a cache of weapons near our farm, took some for himself and some for me. The first time I saw him dispatch a group of the rotters, I was in awe. He told me I must learn. I was scared, but I grew accustomed to it as we all do eventually. 

	We started out, moving slowly west. I have no idea why he picked that direction. Maybe it was the magic of seeing your shadow in the morning rising to meet you. Maybe 
it was the glare of the sunset blinding you. Either way, it just seemed to feel right. Or natural.

	From time to time we would meet up with other survivors and travel a ways together. Picking off the rotters when we saw them. Sharing stories with them. 

	The stories were always the same, drenched in gore and misery and loss. If you've lived long enough to read this, then you know. You've faced your share of loss and looked death in the face with blood still dripping from whatever weapons you've found or fashioned. That's what I'm counting on, of course. But I'm getting ahead of myself. 

	There's no need for a complete recounting of events. We camped, we killed. On occasion we had just as much if not more trouble with other survivors than with the dead.
Bad people exploiting a bad situation for their own gain. You could see it in their eyes sometimes. Just looking for an opportunity. That's why we traveled alone mostly. It's very unsettling sharing camp with people that seem to be sizing you up. To some, a man's life is worth less than the gear he's carrying. 

	We probably would have had even more trouble if we were traveling with women. One time we came across a group of men that had women on chains and were leading them like dogs. They waved to us and asked if we wanted to barter. My father waved back and walked right into the middle of their group. Then he cut each of them down in mere seconds. It was over before I could fully comprehend what had happened. But the ground soaked up the blood quickly and soon they were just more dead scraps in a dead world.

	He cut the women loose and gave them directions to the nearest village. They camped with us that night. My father didn't sleep at all as far as I know. I slept fitfully and each time I woke he was sitting guard. He sent them on their way the next morning. I have no idea if they ever made it to that village or not. Or what they found if they did. 

	We were both very fortunate and very lucky to have survived some of these encounters. I guess I still underestimate my father's skill with a sword. We trained each day and I was improving, but I would never have his natural grace. 

	Like I said, we traveled alone mostly. Slowly moving to the west. It didn't take too many uncomfortable encounters before we just avoided other groups instinctively. The road is a lonely place, and it goes on much longer than we will.

	I guess this brings me to the old broken temple in Whiterun. And Jebidiah's journal. This would be a few months after the initial Rising. We found the journal in front of the alter while seeking shelter from the rain one night. It was lousy shelter. And considering everything since, I'd give anything if we'd just ridden the storm out. 	                     

	But no, we stopped. My father picked up the book and became fascinated with it. 
I don't know why he picked it up to begin with. What did he think it was, a bible? What good would that do us? But he read it. Then he read it again. Then he had me read it. Then he read it again. Maybe fascinated was the wrong word. Maybe obsessed would be better. 

	He told me it was now our responsibility to take the book to Jebidiah's sister-in-law. Sarah. He talked about her like he knew her. He said that people must know about the Rumiirua, the summoning, the Mage's guild. He thought the answer to their undoing was in that book. He was close to right, I guess. Funny how things work out.                                                              

	Sarah lived in a village not far from Whiterun, and in the direction we were heading anyhow. My father thought this was providence. He said we were meant to find the journal and deliver it, and that with this information, the Rumiirua could be stopped.
So we set out to find Sarah. That's when things really went to shit.

	I guess the first thing to tell you is that we didn't find her. Well, pieces of her, I guess, no way of knowing for sure. It was just over a days journey, and when we arrived we found almost everyone in the town slaughtered. There were three survivors, I don't recall their names. A man, his sister, and another woman I'm not sure either of them really knew. 

	They had survived the attack on their town by hiding in a cellar and barring the door. You hear that Jebidiah, you stupid bastard? The cellar! They hid in the cellar and they survived.

	We asked about Sarah Halfwitch, assuming she had taken her husbands name, and were not disappointed. The man's sister told us where we could find the home. There was certainly no love for the Halfwitches from her. She spit on the ground every time she spoke the name. Something about the great-grandmother and where the family name came from presumably. 

	We arrived at the home to find just what you'd expect, only slightly more decayed than we were used to. She and whoever had been with her (three others, judging by the mess), had been dead a long time. But someone else had been here since they were slaughtered. The words Southfringe Sanctum had been written on the wall in their blood. My father and I stared at it for a long time, neither of us speaking. Finally he hefted his pack, slung it over his shoulder, gave me a look and walked out the door. After a minute longer staring at the blood writing on the wall by myself, followed after him. There were no answers here. Only more questions. 

	The three strangers we met were nowhere to be seen. We left as quietly as we had come. Moving to the south this time. My father must have felt some kind of depression at not being able to give the journal to Sarah. Maybe he felt some kind of burden now that the journal was his and there was no-one to pass it off to. I don't know, he never spoke of it. But he would read it each night at our camp fire. He would cling to it.

	It occurred to me for the first time then that we never truly know our fathers. The lives they lived, the men they were before we came along. There's so much I never knew about him. No sense dwelling on that I suppose.

	We moved to the south, through Riverwood, the Throat of the World looming to the east. We passed through Helgen and made our way to Southfringe Sanctum. It was a long journey, but at least we had a destination. We didn't see much in the way of the Rumiirua. But we saw the devastation everywhere. Almost no signs of life.

	I'll spare you the details of our journey south other than to tell you the closer we got to Southfringe Sanctum, the more dread I began to feel. Who, after all, had written those words in blood on the wall? And why? And for whom? These were questions that, the closer we traveled to our destination, the less I wanted to know the answers.

	We finally arrived in Southfringe to find nothing. Nothing new anyhow. Waste and destruction. What appeared to be a hastily abandoned military camp. My father said nothing. He just set about making camp.

	We made our camp on the remains of theirs and built a fire. We were just turning in to sleep when we heard the voice. It was slow and wise, almost angelic.

	'Sebastian Cain', it said. 'I have waited long for you. May I join you at your fire?'

	My father was on his feet in an instant, sword already drawn. 'Show yourself, witch', he said looking around in all directions as if addressing the night itself.

	'I am no witch' the voice said. 'And I mean you no harm. Will you put away your sword, or will you strike down the answers you seek?'

	'How do you know my name?', my father challenged.

	'I know much, and I see much. I have watched you for some time, Sebastian, Champion of Tamriel', the voice said. 'I know you are pure of heart. I know you would avenge your wife and child. And I know mostly, you would see this evil laid to rest, lest it consume everything. As it will if left unchecked'

	'Then it was you who left the message in the Halfwitch home?', my father asked.

	'It was indeed.'

	My father did not sheath his sword, but he did lower it so that it pointed to the ground. 'Come then', he said. 'Join us at the fire'

	She stepped out of the shadows like she was simply materializing into view. And in just a few steps was at the fire. I had never seen anything like her. She was beautiful and foreboding at the same time. She wore a strange headdress that seemed to merge with her clothing. It appeared to be a falcon. It was quite bizarre looking at her face and seeing the face of a bird just above it. The cloak was attached at her wrists and if she held her arms out it would appear that she had wings. Of course the whole ensemble was made of feathers. 

	'You may put away your sword too, Young Deckard' she said as she turned to regard me.

	I didn't even realize I had drawn it. I blushed as I lowered it. I hoped she wouldn't see it by the dying firelight, but suspected she would know anyhow.

	'Fetch some more wood, boy' my father said.

	Before I could even turn around to set about doing so, she simply waved her hand over the fire and it sprang to life. 'There's no need', she said. 'Come and sit'

	It struck me as odd that she was inviting us to our own fire, but we both obeyed.

	'My name', she said, 'is Teela-Na. I have come a great distance to find you.'

	'Can you stop these creatures?', my father asked. No beating around the bush for him. Straight to it.

	'No, I can not', she said. 'But you can. And I can help you.'

	'These creatures you call Rumiirua, they were created by an evil wizard sometimes known as Keldor.' My father perked up at that name.

	'Yes', she said. 'You know the name from Jebidiah's journal.'

	'The traveler Russio met', my father agreed. 

	'Keldor was admiring his handiwork, I imagine', she said. 'Spreading fear as well as death.' 

	'How do you know him', my father asked.

	'He and I both come from a world called Eternia.' My father nodded at this as if it confirmed what he suspected. 'You know most the story already from Jebidiah's book, what you need to know anyhow.'

	'So this monster comes from your world, lays waste to ours, and you won't lift a finger to help?' I drew in a deep breath at this outburst from my father.

	'I am the keeper and protector of a great power and a great secret on Eternia. It is my duty and purpose in life', she said. 'And I channel some of that power to do what must be done. Outside the walls of Cast- of my home, I do not have access to any of those powers.'

	'My father gestured toward to roaring fire as if to say 'Then what is this shit?'

	The mystical lady just smiled. 'Such simple conjurers tricks will do nothing to break the spell Keldor has cast. And I am essentially powerless in your world.'

	My father seemed to accept this so she went on.

	'Keldor found an ancient artifact we had thought was only a myth, called the Spellstone. He used it to animate the dead and set them on a warpath to the Mage's Guild, killing everything in their path, and leaving death in their wake. Increasing their numbers as they go. Even now the Mage's Guild is at war with them and they will not last long. Once the Mages are dead and the Rumiirua have no quest, they will simply wander and kill until there is nothing left of Tamriel but a land of the dead.'   

	'Keldor has left the Spellstone here in your world. It is what keeps them animated. It must be destroyed.'

	'Then tell us where it is and we shall destroy it', my father said.

	'It is not so simple,' she replied. 'The Spellstone has been bonded with a guardian. The stone's essence, if you will, has merged with him and will protect him. And as long as he lives, the Rumiirua will sweep across your land like a plague.'

	'He has gone by many names. Sometimes Osiris, sometimes Khenti-Amentiu. He is also called Raab AlMout, which means Lord of the Dead. He will be essentially invincible on your world to your weapons. But I can give you a weapon, a sword, that will break the magic protecting him and destroy the Spellstone's curse' 

	As she said this she produced a sword from underneath her feathered cloak and held it out to my father. I have no idea how she had hidden such a thing under there.

	'A sword of power?', my father asked.

	Teela-Na could not have recoiled more if he had slapped her.

	'Ancients no!', she said. 'Such a thing could never be brought and left here. This is just a sword with a special enchantment I prepared before leaving my refuge. But it is sufficient to penetrate Keldor's spell.'

	My father clearly had questions about this but kept them to himself, as he reached out to take the sword.

	'You will journey to Halldir's Cairn and there you will find him. I am sure he will be well guarded, and a spell must be spoken to activate the enchantment. You must speak this spell within range of both the sword you hold and Raab AlMout. Then strike him down. The magic of the Spellstone will be broken. And once your task is complete the enchantment on your sword will dissipate. The words you must speak are 'Ma qu-a aljamjima alramaadia'. Now, repeat it for me.'

	My father did as told, then asked 'You say the magic will dissipate, What will happen to the actual Spellstone? Will he be carrying it?'

	'I imagine Keldor still holds the actual stone. Probably the magic will leave Osiris when he dies and return to the stone.'

	'So this Keldor... he could do this again? He will still have the magic of the stone even after all we do?', my father asked. 'This is all for nothing?'

	'He may indeed regain this power. But it will be our problem on Eternia if he does. I have destroyed his means of traveling into this world to make sure something like this doesn't happen here again. He will certainly retaliate once he discovers what I have done. But it is well past time that we faced him directly. We've underestimated him for far too long. Maybe out of fear, maybe from complacency. We are not ready for a foe of his magnitude. We have had peace for too long. The Masters have become weak. The coming storm on my world is inevitable. But the fires will be like a forge, and from the ashes will rise a hero worthy of the powers I protect. But none of that concerns you.  The fate of your world, that is in your hands now.'

	My father looked at the sword he held with doubt and trepidation. 'Is there nothing else you can do to help?', he asked. 'You may be powerless here, but is there no other that could help us?'

	This brought a strange look to her face. I could tell she wanted to say something else, but instead she said 'There is one who I think will rise to the challenge, a young prince not much older than you, Deckard. But it is not his time yet. He is not yet ready to meet his destiny. He will be of no help to you '

	My father stood and said 'Then I will do what must be done.'

	'I knew you would', she said. 'I wish you luck and the power of the ancients'

	'I wish you luck against Keldor', my father replied.

	Then she turned and looked at me. 'Safe journeys, young Deckard. You have a long road to travel.' And with that she seemed to melt back into the shadows. My father looked down at the sword in his hand as if to convince himself the meeting did in fact happen. He said we should get what rest we could and set out in the morning.

	That is my tale. Or most of it I guess. The rest you can probably imagine for yourself, considering I told you at the beginning my father was dead. We set out the next morning. We made the long journey to  Halldir's Cairn. We found Raab AlMout's camp and the Rumiirua that stayed behind as guards. Although why such a creature would need guards is beyond me. 

	They weren't paying much attention anyhow. People to eat and all that. My father found a way to sneak around them and confront Raab AlMout directly. He told me to hide and watch while he slew Raab AlMout. I argued, saying that we could attack him together but he would hear none of it. We only had one enchanted sword he said. 

	I watched as he jumped down from the rock outcropping above his foe taking him by surprise. He probably would have succeeded too, but that landing knocked some of the wind from him and he was unable to pronounce the spell properly. When he struck what should have been a killing blow the sword actually bounced back as if he had struck stone. 

	Perfect end to the story right? Everything we had gone through and it ends like this? Well curse the gods of Tamriel. Those of Eternia also. My father was a good man and didn't deserve to die like he did.

	Raab AlMout, after recovering from his shock at being attacked, reached and picked my father up by his neck, and held him there, choking, suspended in the air. The last thing he did was to turn his head somewhat to look at me. He through the sword to me and it landed just before my feet. Then he mouthed the word 'Run.'

	Raab AlMout reached out with his other hand, placed it on top of my father's skull and began to squeeze. His screams were indescribable. Then with a sickening crunch, blood and brain seemed to explode from between his fingers as my father's mostly headless body fell to the ground. It was horrifying, but at least the screaming had stopped.

	What did I do? What do you think? I picked up the sword and ran. I ran and I ran. And did I hear Raab AlMout laughing behind me? Or was that just my imagination? I know not. Eventually I collapsed. I don't know how long I ran or where to, but when I regained consciousness it was night and I was near a stream.

	I drank from it and decided what to do next. What I decided was, I'd write this journal and hope someone else would find it and finish our quest. I'm done with this shit.

	Walking dead, evil wizards, sorceresses with enchanted swords, curses, spells, and oh yeah, a creature that crushes skulls one-handed! To Oblivion with this. I'm done. Tamriel can rot. 

	Unless you care to save it, that is. 

	I've been traveling by day and writing by night. East this time. Shadow no longer rising to meet me in the morning. I've heard of a town known as Tristram and a land called Sanctuary. I'm headed there, hoping to live out the rest of my days away from all this madness. 

	At the edge of Skyrim at a place called Broken Helm Hollow, I will leave this journal. If you find it, the first thing you should know is that I hid the enchanted sword at
Bloodlet Throne. Go there, find it and go on to Halldir's Cairn and slay the monster that keeps the Rumiirua's curse alive. 

	And the chant, don't forget the chant. Ma qu-a aljamjima alramaadia.

	I guess that's it. My story. It's much longer than I'd intended. When I started this I criticized Jebidiah for being to long winded, and here I've rambled on longer than he did. How's that for pathetic? I've rambled on longer than Jebidiah Halfwit! I had good intentions, but you know which road is paved with those. At least I never took an arrow to the knee. I've been told that really sucks.

	I do hope someone finds this. I hope you find it and have the courage to break the spell of the Rumiirua. I hope you find the sword and use it to kill Raab AlMout. I hope you succeed where we failed. I hope that Teela-Na finds a way to stop Keldor. I hope that somewhere on Eternia, there exists someone who has the power to defeat him.

	But most of all I hope to live the rest of my days in peace.

	Fare well, stranger.

	D.C.

&lt;p align="left"&gt;

	You like that? I wrote it sitting by a campfire one night when my father and I were running the back trail of the Rumiirua. I used to dream I'd be a famous bard one day. I dreamt that my father would be proud. Now he's dead and there's no one left to care what I do.

	I decided to call this The Legacy of the Rumiirua to keep it consistent with Jebidiah's journal, even though I prefer The Lord of the Dead. Jebidiah Halfwitch, curse that stupid bastard. If he had just hidden in his cellar like his wife wanted they would all still be alive. More to the point, he wouldn't have written his stupid journal and my family might also be alive. My father at least, is what I mean. My mother and sister were already gone when my father found Jebidiah's book.

	I imagine all kinds of people have written accounts of what happened that first night and every night since. Every day as well, for that matter. Everyone wants to leave behind some kind of legacy. 

	In that respect, Jebidiah's journal was no different than dozens, maybe hundreds of other stories. Except Jebidiah's was the the one my father found. Well, that and the fact that Jebidiah had stumbled across a small bit of the truth of where these monsters came from. 

	My father was a good man by the name of Sebastian Cain. He was a farmer like Jebidiah. And like Jebidiah, had lost all his family except me. He probably felt some sort of kinship to him. Some sympathy or pity. Or maybe just the need to succeed where Jebidiah had failed. In any case, Jebidiah's book set him on a path. 

	But I guess that comes a bit later. I should start with the night when the dead rose, like Jebidiah did. Except I'll try to stay much more on point. Lord, could that man ramble on.

	My name is Deckard, youngest of two brothers. 14 years old the day the dead came back. I had gone with my father into town for supplies that day. Feed, and a bit of lumber for rebuilding fences. We had a farm not far from Windhelm and were traveling back home on horseback pulling our cart around supper time when we saw the first of the dead. It was slowly stumbling along the side of the road by itself when we passed. We thought he was drunk. He moved to swipe at our horse, but was too far away and too slow. He simply lurched towards it and fell over. It was only later that we realized with horror what he must have been. At the time we just laughed at the stupid drunk. My father made some comment about pulling him off the road, but as we looked back he was already getting up.

	We traveled on and forgot about it. About and hour later we began to pass a few homes and farms. The first few were totally silent, which didn't even occur to me then but later I realized we should have heard cows, chickens, horses, something. Then our horses began to spook. Nothing alarming, but you could tell they caught wind of something they didn't like. 

	We came upon a homestead where, as we approached we could hear screaming and crying. My father and I exchanged a nervous glance. He stopped the horses and told me to wait with them while he went to see if he could help with something. I watched him walk to the front door and knock. Then, when there was no answer, he walked around the side of the house and out of my sight.

	I sat and waited, concerned but not scared, as the horses fidgeted nervously . I don't know how long. Then my father came sprinting around the house in a mad panic. As a child, there are few things more terrifying than seeing a parent terrified. My father came sprinting around the corner so fast he lost his footing and almost fell. He caught himself one-handed and kept right on running. When he reached the horses, he jumped on and spurred the horses hard. We took off with a jolt as I asked my father repeatedly what had happened. He wouldn't answer, except to say we needed to get help. 

	We rode like that for a while in silence. Then we began to pass other homes and farms. We heard cries from some of them and saw two men struggling in a field off in the distance. This went on for a few miles. Eventually my father looked at me with panic in his eyes. I asked again what was happening. He stopped the horses, jumped down and unhitched them from the cart. He climbed back on and told me to keep up. He said we were going to ride as fast as we could because we had to get home now.

	We rode for what seemed like an eternity, but it was probably less than an hour. Along the way I began to understand that whatever was happening, it was happening everywhere. And that my mother and older brother were almost certainly in danger. It never occurred to me that we would not make it home in time.

	When we arrived my father once again told me to wait with the horses, which I did briefly. But when I heard his anguished cry from inside I ran as hard as I could. As I reached for the door, what I saw literally took the wind from me. My father was on his knees, kneeling in a pool of blood, holding what was left of my mother to his chest. Her stomach was just a great empty hole with nothing in it. I could actually see her spine. 

	This was the womb where I had grown. Now a gaping hole with gore and scraps of flesh hanging out. That didn't occur to me till later. At the moment I was just in shock and not capable of coherent thought. The rest of her seemed to be missing small pieces here and there. Bites, they looked like. My brother lay near by. He looked even worse. The sounds coming from my father were more horrifying than anything I had ever heard before. I've heard worse since, but not that night.

	Months later, as I write this, looking back, it's all still crystal clear. The sight, every scrap of flesh. The blood everywhere. The smell, rotten meat and shit. But mostly the sounds. My father wailed and wept and drooled. Eventually he went into some kind of daze. Not quite passed out but close. 

	I managed to pull him outside some time later. I was still numb, but I understood that he was in worse shape than me at that time. I had to take care of him. We slept up in the loft of our barn that night.

	We burned them. This was some time the next day. My father came back around the next morning. Around sunrise. He was himself again. We burned the bodies in silence. Neither one of us knew any prayers. What would the point have been anyhow? 

	My mother's name was Myriam. My brother was Jonas. There's nothing left of them now except their names recorded here. There's really nothing left of anything now. 

	That was how it began. My father found new strength after that and set out to kill as many of those things as he could. Back then we still didn't really understand what they were of course. But we traveled and we killed. Oh yes, we. My father taught me well. Skinny fourteen-year-old with a sword and mace. My books put away and the farm forgotten. 

	My father apparently had some previous combat experience he never discussed. Because he led us to a cache of weapons near our farm, took some for himself and some for me. The first time I saw him dispatch a group of the rotters, I was in awe. He told me I must learn. I was scared, but I grew accustomed to it as we all do eventually. 

	We started out, moving slowly west. I have no idea why he picked that direction. Maybe it was the magic of seeing your shadow in the morning rising to meet you. Maybe 
it was the glare of the sunset blinding you. Either way, it just seemed to feel right. Or natural.

	From time to time we would meet up with other survivors and travel a ways together. Picking off the rotters when we saw them. Sharing stories with them. 

	The stories were always the same, drenched in gore and misery and loss. If you've lived long enough to read this, then you know. You've faced your share of loss and looked death in the face with blood still dripping from whatever weapons you've found or fashioned. That's what I'm counting on, of course. But I'm getting ahead of myself. 

	There's no need for a complete recounting of events. We camped, we killed. On occasion we had just as much if not more trouble with other survivors than with the dead.
Bad people exploiting a bad situation for their own gain. You could see it in their eyes sometimes. Just looking for an opportunity. That's why we traveled alone mostly. It's very unsettling sharing camp with people that seem to be sizing you up. To some, a man's life is worth less than the gear he's carrying. 

	We probably would have had even more trouble if we were traveling with women. One time we came across a group of men that had women on chains and were leading them like dogs. They waved to us and asked if we wanted to barter. My father waved back and walked right into the middle of their group. Then he cut each of them down in mere seconds. It was over before I could fully comprehend what had happened. But the ground soaked up the blood quickly and soon they were just more dead scraps in a dead world.

	He cut the women loose and gave them directions to the nearest village. They camped with us that night. My father didn't sleep at all as far as I know. I slept fitfully and each time I woke he was sitting guard. He sent them on their way the next morning. I have no idea if they ever made it to that village or not. Or what they found if they did. 

	We were both very fortunate and very lucky to have survived some of these encounters. I guess I still underestimate my father's skill with a sword. We trained each day and I was improving, but I would never have his natural grace. 

	Like I said, we traveled alone mostly. Slowly moving to the west. It didn't take too many uncomfortable encounters before we just avoided other groups instinctively. The road is a lonely place, and it goes on much longer than we will.

	I guess this brings me to the old broken temple in Whiterun. And Jebidiah's journal. This would be a few months after the initial Rising. We found the journal in front of the alter while seeking shelter from the rain one night. It was lousy shelter. And considering everything since, I'd give anything if we'd just ridden the storm out. 	                     

	But no, we stopped. My father picked up the book and became fascinated with it. 
I don't know why he picked it up to begin with. What did he think it was, a bible? What good would that do us? But he read it. Then he read it again. Then he had me read it. Then he read it again. Maybe fascinated was the wrong word. Maybe obsessed would be better. 

	He told me it was now our responsibility to take the book to Jebidiah's sister-in-law. Sarah. He talked about her like he knew her. He said that people must know about the Rumiirua, the summoning, the Mage's guild. He thought the answer to their undoing was in that book. He was close to right, I guess. Funny how things work out.                                                              

	Sarah lived in a village not far from Whiterun, and in the direction we were heading anyhow. My father thought this was providence. He said we were meant to find the journal and deliver it, and that with this information, the Rumiirua could be stopped.
So we set out to find Sarah. That's when things really went to shit.

	I guess the first thing to tell you is that we didn't find her. Well, pieces of her, I guess, no way of knowing for sure. It was just over a days journey, and when we arrived we found almost everyone in the town slaughtered. There were three survivors, I don't recall their names. A man, his sister, and another woman I'm not sure either of them really knew. 

	They had survived the attack on their town by hiding in a cellar and barring the door. You hear that Jebidiah, you stupid bastard? The cellar! They hid in the cellar and they survived.

	We asked about Sarah Halfwitch, assuming she had taken her husbands name, and were not disappointed. The man's sister told us where we could find the home. There was certainly no love for the Halfwitches from her. She spit on the ground every time she spoke the name. Something about the great-grandmother and where the family name came from presumably. 

	We arrived at the home to find just what you'd expect, only slightly more decayed than we were used to. She and whoever had been with her (three others, judging by the mess), had been dead a long time. But someone else had been here since they were slaughtered. The words Southfringe Sanctum had been written on the wall in their blood. My father and I stared at it for a long time, neither of us speaking. Finally he hefted his pack, slung it over his shoulder, gave me a look and walked out the door. After a minute longer staring at the blood writing on the wall by myself, followed after him. There were no answers here. Only more questions. 

	The three strangers we met were nowhere to be seen. We left as quietly as we had come. Moving to the south this time. My father must have felt some kind of depression at not being able to give the journal to Sarah. Maybe he felt some kind of burden now that the journal was his and there was no-one to pass it off to. I don't know, he never spoke of it. But he would read it each night at our camp fire. He would cling to it.

	It occurred to me for the first time then that we never truly know our fathers. The lives they lived, the men they were before we came along. There's so much I never knew about him. No sense dwelling on that I suppose.

	We moved to the south, through Riverwood, the Throat of the World looming to the east. We passed through Helgen and made our way to Southfringe Sanctum. It was a long journey, but at least we had a destination. We didn't see much in the way of the Rumiirua. But we saw the devastation everywhere. Almost no signs of life.

	I'll spare you the details of our journey south other than to tell you the closer we got to Southfringe Sanctum, the more dread I began to feel. Who, after all, had written those words in blood on the wall? And why? And for whom? These were questions that, the closer we traveled to our destination, the less I wanted to know the answers.

	We finally arrived in Southfringe to find nothing. Nothing new anyhow. Waste and destruction. What appeared to be a hastily abandoned military camp. My father said nothing. He just set about making camp.

	We made our camp on the remains of theirs and built a fire. We were just turning in to sleep when we heard the voice. It was slow and wise, almost angelic.

	'Sebastian Cain', it said. 'I have waited long for you. May I join you at your fire?'

	My father was on his feet in an instant, sword already drawn. 'Show yourself, witch', he said looking around in all directions as if addressing the night itself.

	'I am no witch' the voice said. 'And I mean you no harm. Will you put away your sword, or will you strike down the answers you seek?'

	'How do you know my name?', my father challenged.

	'I know much, and I see much. I have watched you for some time, Sebastian, Champion of Tamriel', the voice said. 'I know you are pure of heart. I know you would avenge your wife and child. And I know mostly, you would see this evil laid to rest, lest it consume everything. As it will if left unchecked'

	'Then it was you who left the message in the Halfwitch home?', my father asked.

	'It was indeed.'

	My father did not sheath his sword, but he did lower it so that it pointed to the ground. 'Come then', he said. 'Join us at the fire'

	She stepped out of the shadows like she was simply materializing into view. And in just a few steps was at the fire. I had never seen anything like her. She was beautiful and foreboding at the same time. She wore a strange headdress that seemed to merge with her clothing. It appeared to be a falcon. It was quite bizarre looking at her face and seeing the face of a bird just above it. The cloak was attached at her wrists and if she held her arms out it would appear that she had wings. Of course the whole ensemble was made of feathers. 

	'You may put away your sword too, Young Deckard' she said as she turned to regard me.

	I didn't even realize I had drawn it. I blushed as I lowered it. I hoped she wouldn't see it by the dying firelight, but suspected she would know anyhow.

	'Fetch some more wood, boy' my father said.

	Before I could even turn around to set about doing so, she simply waved her hand over the fire and it sprang to life. 'There's no need', she said. 'Come and sit'

	It struck me as odd that she was inviting us to our own fire, but we both obeyed.

	'My name', she said, 'is Teela-Na. I have come a great distance to find you.'

	'Can you stop these creatures?', my father asked. No beating around the bush for him. Straight to it.

	'No, I can not', she said. 'But you can. And I can help you.'

	'These creatures you call Rumiirua, they were created by an evil wizard sometimes known as Keldor.' My father perked up at that name.

	'Yes', she said. 'You know the name from Jebidiah's journal.'

	'The traveler Russio met', my father agreed. 

	'Keldor was admiring his handiwork, I imagine', she said. 'Spreading fear as well as death.' 

	'How do you know him', my father asked.

	'He and I both come from a world called Eternia.' My father nodded at this as if it confirmed what he suspected. 'You know most the story already from Jebidiah's book, what you need to know anyhow.'

	'So this monster comes from your world, lays waste to ours, and you won't lift a finger to help?' I drew in a deep breath at this outburst from my father.

	'I am the keeper and protector of a great power and a great secret on Eternia. It is my duty and purpose in life', she said. 'And I channel some of that power to do what must be done. Outside the walls of Cast- of my home, I do not have access to any of those powers.'

	'My father gestured toward to roaring fire as if to say 'Then what is this shit?'

	The mystical lady just smiled. 'Such simple conjurers tricks will do nothing to break the spell Keldor has cast. And I am essentially powerless in your world.'

	My father seemed to accept this so she went on.

	'Keldor found an ancient artifact we had thought was only a myth, called the Spellstone. He used it to animate the dead and set them on a warpath to the Mage's Guild, killing everything in their path, and leaving death in their wake. Increasing their numbers as they go. Even now the Mage's Guild is at war with them and they will not last long. Once the Mages are dead and the Rumiirua have no quest, they will simply wander and kill until there is nothing left of Tamriel but a land of the dead.'   

	'Keldor has left the Spellstone here in your world. It is what keeps them animated. It must be destroyed.'

	'Then tell us where it is and we shall destroy it', my father said.

	'It is not so simple,' she replied. 'The Spellstone has been bonded with a guardian. The stone's essence, if you will, has merged with him and will protect him. And as long as he lives, the Rumiirua will sweep across your land like a plague.'

	'He has gone by many names. Sometimes Osiris, sometimes Khenti-Amentiu. He is also called Raab AlMout, which means Lord of the Dead. He will be essentially invincible on your world to your weapons. But I can give you a weapon, a sword, that will break the magic protecting him and destroy the Spellstone's curse' 

	As she said this she produced a sword from underneath her feathered cloak and held it out to my father. I have no idea how she had hidden such a thing under there.

	'A sword of power?', my father asked.

	Teela-Na could not have recoiled more if he had slapped her.

	'Ancients no!', she said. 'Such a thing could never be brought and left here. This is just a sword with a special enchantment I prepared before leaving my refuge. But it is sufficient to penetrate Keldor's spell.'

	My father clearly had questions about this but kept them to himself, as he reached out to take the sword.

	'You will journey to Halldir's Cairn and there you will find him. I am sure he will be well guarded, and a spell must be spoken to activate the enchantment. You must speak this spell within range of both the sword you hold and Raab AlMout. Then strike him down. The magic of the Spellstone will be broken. And once your task is complete the enchantment on your sword will dissipate. The words you must speak are 'Ma qu-a aljamjima alramaadia'. Now, repeat it for me.'

	My father did as told, then asked 'You say the magic will dissipate, What will happen to the actual Spellstone? Will he be carrying it?'

	'I imagine Keldor still holds the actual stone. Probably the magic will leave Osiris when he dies and return to the stone.'

	'So this Keldor... he could do this again? He will still have the magic of the stone even after all we do?', my father asked. 'This is all for nothing?'

	'He may indeed regain this power. But it will be our problem on Eternia if he does. I have destroyed his means of traveling into this world to make sure something like this doesn't happen here again. He will certainly retaliate once he discovers what I have done. But it is well past time that we faced him directly. We've underestimated him for far too long. Maybe out of fear, maybe from complacency. We are not ready for a foe of his magnitude. We have had peace for too long. The Masters have become weak. The coming storm on my world is inevitable. But the fires will be like a forge, and from the ashes will rise a hero worthy of the powers I protect. But none of that concerns you.  The fate of your world, that is in your hands now.'

	My father looked at the sword he held with doubt and trepidation. 'Is there nothing else you can do to help?', he asked. 'You may be powerless here, but is there no other that could help us?'

	This brought a strange look to her face. I could tell she wanted to say something else, but instead she said 'There is one who I think will rise to the challenge, a young prince not much older than you, Deckard. But it is not his time yet. He is not yet ready to meet his destiny. He will be of no help to you '

	My father stood and said 'Then I will do what must be done.'

	'I knew you would', she said. 'I wish you luck and the power of the ancients'

	'I wish you luck against Keldor', my father replied.

	Then she turned and looked at me. 'Safe journeys, young Deckard. You have a long road to travel.' And with that she seemed to melt back into the shadows. My father looked down at the sword in his hand as if to convince himself the meeting did in fact happen. He said we should get what rest we could and set out in the morning.

	That is my tale. Or most of it I guess. The rest you can probably imagine for yourself, considering I told you at the beginning my father was dead. We set out the next morning. We made the long journey to  Halldir's Cairn. We found Raab AlMout's camp and the Rumiirua that stayed behind as guards. Although why such a creature would need guards is beyond me. 

	They weren't paying much attention anyhow. People to eat and all that. My father found a way to sneak around them and confront Raab AlMout directly. He told me to hide and watch while he slew Raab AlMout. I argued, saying that we could attack him together but he would hear none of it. We only had one enchanted sword he said. 

	I watched as he jumped down from the rock outcropping above his foe taking him by surprise. He probably would have succeeded too, but that landing knocked some of the wind from him and he was unable to pronounce the spell properly. When he struck what should have been a killing blow the sword actually bounced back as if he had struck stone. 

	Perfect end to the story right? Everything we had gone through and it ends like this? Well curse the gods of Tamriel. Those of Eternia also. My father was a good man and didn't deserve to die like he did.

	Raab AlMout, after recovering from his shock at being attacked, reached and picked my father up by his neck, and held him there, choking, suspended in the air. The last thing he did was to turn his head somewhat to look at me. He through the sword to me and it landed just before my feet. Then he mouthed the word 'Run.'

	Raab AlMout reached out with his other hand, placed it on top of my father's skull and began to squeeze. His screams were indescribable. Then with a sickening crunch, blood and brain seemed to explode from between his fingers as my father's mostly headless body fell to the ground. It was horrifying, but at least the screaming had stopped.

	What did I do? What do you think? I picked up the sword and ran. I ran and I ran. And did I hear Raab AlMout laughing behind me? Or was that just my imagination? I know not. Eventually I collapsed. I don't know how long I ran or where to, but when I regained consciousness it was night and I was near a stream.

	I drank from it and decided what to do next. What I decided was, I'd write this journal and hope someone else would find it and finish our quest. I'm done with this shit.

	Walking dead, evil wizards, sorceresses with enchanted swords, curses, spells, and oh yeah, a creature that crushes skulls one-handed! To Oblivion with this. I'm done. Tamriel can rot. 

	Unless you care to save it, that is. 

	I've been traveling by day and writing by night. East this time. Shadow no longer rising to meet me in the morning. I've heard of a town known as Tristram and a land called Sanctuary. I'm headed there, hoping to live out the rest of my days away from all this madness. 

	At the edge of Skyrim at a place called Broken Helm Hollow, I will leave this journal. If you find it, the first thing you should know is that I hid the enchanted sword at
Bloodlet Throne. Go there, find it and go on to Halldir's Cairn and slay the monster that keeps the Rumiirua's curse alive. 

	And the chant, don't forget the chant. Ma qu-a aljamjima alramaadia.

	I guess that's it. My story. It's much longer than I'd intended. When I started this I criticized Jebidiah for being to long winded, and here I've rambled on longer than he did. How's that for pathetic? I've rambled on longer than Jebidiah Halfwit! I had good intentions, but you know which road is paved with those. At least I never took an arrow to the knee. I've been told that really sucks.

	I do hope someone finds this. I hope you find it and have the courage to break the spell of the Rumiirua. I hope you find the sword and use it to kill Raab AlMout. I hope you succeed where we failed. I hope that Teela-Na finds a way to stop Keldor. I hope that somewhere on Eternia, there exists someone who has the power to defeat him.

	But most of all I hope to live the rest of my days in peace.

	Fare well, stranger.

	D.C.
